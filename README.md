# OpenReliant

OpenReliant is an open-source, faithful engine reimplementation of **StarLancer**, the space combat simulator developed by Warthog and Digital Anvil and published by Microsoft in 2000.

Written in **Zig** and built on **SDL3**, OpenReliant renders with Vulkan (Metal on macOS) via SDL's GPU API. It runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows using assets directly from your retail copy of the game.

## Legal & Asset Policy

OpenReliant is an independent, non-commercial open-source project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Warthog Games, Digital Anvil, or Microsoft. StarLancer is a trademark of its respective owner.

**This repository contains no copyrighted game assets**: no textures, 3D models, sound effects, music, cinematics, mission scripts, or game binaries. OpenReliant requires assets extracted from a legally owned copy of StarLancer to run. We do not support or condone software piracy.

## Current Status

OpenReliant is in beta. The whole campaign is playable from the first mission to the end, and the games saved in the original carry on.

- **Flight & Combat**: All ships, with the original flight model, weapons, damage, AI and cockpit displays, and 8 camera views including 3D cockpits.
- **Missions**: Retail and custom mission files load, and their scripts run in full, with every command the single-player missions use.
- **Controls**: Mouse and keyboard, flight sticks, HOTAS and gamepads, with force feedback played as rumble, and the bindings set in the game's controls screen.
- **Graphics**: Per-pixel shading with gamma-corrected lighting, and real-time shadows. Rendering runs at native resolution in 32-bit colour, with bloom, anti-aliasing, smooth motion at high frame rates, and more detailed explosions, shields and planets. `--original` restores the original graphics and sound.
- **Audio**: 3D positional sound with reverb and headphone HRTF.
- **Mods**: Archives and folders in the game's `mods` folder can replace or add to any of the game's files: models, sounds, music, speech, movies and missions. PNG pictures of any size can replace textures, with material maps for physically based shading (normal maps, highlights, glow and sky reflections), and the interface's shapes and backgrounds, including widescreen ones. Mods can add ship types, guns, missiles and pilots with their own faces and voices, and models built from OBJ or glTF. Scripts in Luau can change the game's records, hook its functions and the missions' commands, run on ships, missiles and turrets, draw on the display and the menus, offer a page of options, add game modes and campaigns, change the game's own campaign, its missions and the KILLBOARD, change the AI's combat maneuvers, and add shaders. A mods screen turns mods on and off, sets their load order, and shows which mods replace each other's files and which mods a mod needs. The scripting API is stable from 0.8 on ([What mods can do](docs/guide/what-mods-can-do.md), [Modding](docs/guide/modding.md), [Scripting](docs/guide/scripting.md)).
- **Front End**: The main menu, the settings screen with its audio, controls, video and graphics, the pilot roster, the saved games and the Reliant's and the Yamato's rooms, with a new pilot's induction, the news reports, the in-game options, the simulator pod, the locker, the CD player, the briefings, the loadout, the ITAC and the story's end.
- **In Development**: A mission editor, then multiplayer, and later a standalone engine that other space games can use. See the [milestones](../../milestones) for the roadmap.

## Bugs & Feedback

Open an issue with the form that fits:

- [Bug report](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml): something doesn't work, or works differently from the original game.
- [Feedback](../../issues/new?template=feedback.yml): how the game plays, and anything that feels wrong or unlike the original.
- [Mod or scripting problem](../../issues/new?template=mod_problem.yml): a mod that doesn't load or work as it should, or a problem with the scripting API.
- [Feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.yml): something OpenReliant doesn't do yet.

A bug report asks for `openreliant.log` from your game folder ([The log file](docs/guide/installation.md#the-log-file)).

## Support

OpenReliant is free. If you'd like to sponsor the time I put into it, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/vdmkenny). It's fully optional, only if you're willing and able to.

## Quickstart

Download the archive for your system from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) and extract it, then follow the [installation guide](docs/guide/installation.md): it installs the game's files from your StarLancer discs or disc images, and starts the game.

---

## Building from Source

Building OpenReliant needs [Zig 0.17](https://ziglang.org): see [Building from source](docs/guide/installation.md#building-from-source). [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the workflow for working on it.

---

## Reverse Engineering & Analysis Tools

The repository includes tools used during reverse engineering. `make help` lists the workflows, and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) and the [toolchain](docs/toolchain.md) describe them.

The `sltool` utility, included with `openreliant` in each release, inspects, exports and packs the game's file formats. `zig build sltool` builds it alone from the sources, without the game. It exits with 0 on success, 2 for an unknown command (after printing its usage) and 1 on failure (with the error on stderr), so a mod's build scripts can use it:

| Command | Description | Documentation |
|---|---|---|
| `sltool cd` | Inspect CD images, ISO 9660 filesystems, DiscJuggler `.cdi` images and Xbox discs | [disc-images](docs/formats/disc-images.md), [xbox](docs/formats/xbox.md) |
| `sltool hog` | Extract and pack `.HOG` archives (`BIGF` container / RefPack) | [hog](docs/formats/hog.md), [refpack](docs/formats/refpack.md) |
| `sltool shp` | Inspect `.SHP` 3D models; export Wavefront OBJ or glTF; build a mod's model from OBJ or glTF | [shp](docs/formats/shp.md) |
| `sltool spr` | Inspect `.SPR` 2D interface sprites; export PNG | [spr](docs/formats/spr.md) |
| `sltool tcache` | Extract texture caches to PNG | [tcache](docs/formats/tcache.md) |
| `sltool fat` | Extract `.fat` sound banks to WAV | [fat](docs/formats/fat.md) |
| `sltool speech` | Decode the radio's speech files to WAV; encode WAV to a speech file for a mod | [speech](docs/formats/speech.md) |
| `sltool fm8` | Extract the radio's face films to PNG frames; encode PNG frames to a film for a mod | [fm8](docs/formats/fm8.md) |
| `sltool fnt` | Render `.fnt` bitmap fonts into glyph atlases | [fnt](docs/formats/fnt.md) |
| `sltool dte` | List a `.DTE` mission's ships, triggers and script parts; disassemble its bytecode | [dte](docs/formats/dte.md) |
| `sltool save` | Show what saved games hold | [save](docs/formats/save.md) |
| `sltool stats` | Parse ship, weapon, and pilot stat tables | [stats](docs/formats/stats.md) |
| `sltool dreamcast` | Read the Dreamcast version's text tables and texture cache; export its textures to PNG | [dreamcast](docs/formats/dreamcast.md) |

| `sltool bsg` | Read Battlestar Galactica's missions, its command catalogue, its comms films and its archives; convert its models to glTF and its textures to PNG; its missions keep StarLancer's records | [battlestar-galactica](docs/games/battlestar-galactica.md) |
| `sltool tim` | Convert PlayStation TIM pictures to PNG | [playstation](docs/formats/playstation.md) |
