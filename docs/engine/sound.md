# Sound

How the game plays its sounds through the Miles Sound System (`MSS32.DLL`): the banks' sounds on voices of their own, the effects placed in 3D around the camera, and the music. OpenReliant's code is [`game/hog_snd.zig`](../../src/engine/game/hog_snd.zig) and [`game/sound3d.zig`](../../src/engine/game/sound3d.zig); what stands in for Miles is in [Sound in OpenReliant](../port/sound.md). The banks are [`.fat` files](../formats/fat.md).

## Start-up

`WinMain` calls `sound_init` (`0x00481440`) with 10 voices. It starts Miles, opens a digital driver at 22,050 Hz in 16-bit stereo, or at 11,025 Hz where that fails (`sound_driver_open`, `0x00482D10`), allocates a sample for each voice, and starts the 100 Hz timer, `tick_timer` (`0x004827C0`). Asked for them, it also opens the CD's audio and sets aside two more samples and a double buffer for the radio's speech. `sound_3d_providers` (`0x004817E0`) lists Miles's 3D providers and `sound_3d_open` (`0x00481900`) opens the one the settings name, else the first of `Miles Fast 2D Positional Audio`, `Aureal A3D Interactive (TM)`, `Creative Labs EAX (TM)` and `RAD Game Tools RSX 3D Audio`, with `Dolby Surround` for one of them where asked. It allocates a 3D voice for each sample the provider supports, up to 64, and sets the effects up on them (`sound3d_init`). That sets the provider's room to EAX's generic one (`AIL_set_3D_room_type`, 0), with a damping of 1 and an effect volume and decay time of 0, and each 3D sound it plays gets an effects level of 0, with no obstruction or occlusion: the room's reverb is never heard.

As the game's window is put away (`window_suspended`, `0x005DDD28`, which `0x004A8260` sets and `input_init` clears) while the renderer runs (`app_active`, `0x005D6CAC`), the message pump (`message_pump`, `0x004AAB20`) pauses the music, the 3D voices and the voices, where no video is playing, and waits on the window's messages; once the window is back, it resumes the sound. `app_inactive_paused` (`0x005D6CAD`) remembers that it paused. Only in a multiplayer session with a mission loaded does it pause the mission too (`game_pause`), which then stays in its [pause menu](pause-menu.md). In single player the mission is not paused, and the timer's ticks go on while the pump waits. **Unverified:** that the mission runs the ticks it missed once the window is active again.

## Volumes

Four settings, each from 0 to 127, in `[Sound]` of `starlancer.ini`, which the options screen resets
to their defaults:

| Key | Address | Default | Scales |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Mastervolume` | `0x005D5A70` | 127 | everything |
| `Fxvolume` | `0x005D5A74` | 80 | the banks' sounds and the 3D sounds |
| `Musicvolume` | `0x005D55EC` | 80 | the music |
| `Speechvolume` | `0x005D5E88` | 127 | the radio's speech |

`sound_volumes_apply` (`0x00482990`) sets them again on the music and every voice playing when one
changes.

## The banks' sounds

A voice of `sound_voices` (`0x00565080`) is `0x20` bytes:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `0x00` | Miles's sample |
| `0x04` | Set while the display holds the voice (`hud_draw`) |
| `0x08` | The playing sound's priority, from its bank entry |
| `0x10` | Set while it fades out |
| `0x14` | What each step of the fade takes off its volume |
| `0x18` | The sound's own rate |
| `0x1C` | Its volume as asked, 0 to 127 |

`sound_play` (`0x00481F80`) plays sound `n` of a bank at a volume, a loop count, a pan and a pitch.
It takes the first voice past voice 0 that has finished; else the first that was stopped; else the
voice of lowest priority not held by the display, which it ends, if that priority is below the new
sound's. `sound_play_on_voice` (`0x004820C0`) plays on a given voice. `sound_start` (`0x004826A0`)
hands Miles the WAVE file at the entry's offset in the bank, at its own rate times `2^(n/24)` for a
pitch of `n` quarter tones (`0x00481400`, clamped to 96 each way), and at the volume
`round(((Fxvolume × volume) / 128) × Mastervolume / 127)`.

**Improvement:** OpenReliant divides by 127 where the game multiplies by a rounded reciprocal, for
the master volume's share (`0x004DC6B0`) and the engine's volume (`0x004DC9C8`), and divides a 3D
sound's length by the bytes a tick plays where the game multiplies by their reciprocal
(`0x004DC8B8`).

Every five ticks `tick_timer` steps the fades: a fading voice loses its step of volume and ends at
nothing. `sound_voice_fade` (`0x004824C0`) and `sound_fade_all` (`0x00482510`) start them;
`sound_pause_all` (`0x004825D0`) and `sound_resume_all` (`0x00482630`) stop the playing voices and
start them again.

The timer is a multimedia timer of its own (`timer_start`, `0x004A70F0`), so the fades continue
while a movie plays: the menu music, which starts fading out when a campaign starts, is gone half a
second into the new pilot's intro. OpenReliant runs the timer once a frame from each of its loops,
including the movie loop (`hog_snd.Sound.runTimer`).

### Positional sounds of a frame

`sound_buffer_at` (`0x00482160`) gathers a sound of the first 18 slots at a place in the world: its
level in each ear from its distance and which side of the camera it lies. Once a frame
`sound_buffers_play` (`0x004822F0`) plays each slot gathered as sound `n` of `bank_stdsmp`, panned
by its two levels and as loud as the louder, then clears them.

## 3D sounds

Each effect is a definition of the table at `0x00507140`, `0x44` bytes each, closed by a record
whose entry is -1; `make sound-tables` derives
[`sound3d/sounds.zig`](../../src/engine/game/sound3d/sounds.zig) from it.

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `0x00` | The sound in `smp3d.fat` |
| `0x04` | Its share of the effects volume |
| `0x08` | Loop count, 0 for ever |
| `0x0C` | What it follows (below) |
| `0x10` | Minimum distance: heard at full volume within it |
| `0x14` | Maximum distance: not started, and ended, beyond it |
| `0x18`, `0x1C` | The cone's inner and outer angles, in degrees |
| `0x20` | The volume outside the outer cone, of 127 |
| `0x24` | Its name, such as `GUN01`, `EXPLOSION01`, `PSHIP01` |

What a sound follows sets its place as it starts and each frame after:

| Value | Follows |
|---|---|
| 0 | A shot, by its record in the bullet pool: where it is, and its heading |
| 1 | A point and a direction given as it starts |
| 2 | A point given as it starts |
| 3 | A missile, by its record at `0x005887F0` |
| 4 | An object, by its slot; the player's own 200 units from its ship |

A 3D voice is `0x44` bytes at `0x00563F60`: Miles's 3D sample at `0x00`, what it follows at
`0x04`, its owner at `0x08` (-1 while free), the priority at `0x10`, the maximum distance at `0x14`,
the point and direction at `0x18` and `0x24`, whether it was borrowed at `0x34`, the sound at
`0x38`, the frame it started at `0x3C`, and the sound decompressed to PCM at `0x40`.

### Voice classes

Each 3D voice has a class (`0x0058CB1C`), from one of three rows at `0x005085B4` by how many voices
the provider has: up to 14, up to 30, or more. The names are the executable's own (`0x00508614`):

| Class | Name |
|---|---|
| 0 | not reserved |
| 1 | player guns |
| 2 | player fx |
| 3 | explosions |
| 4 | guaranteed |
| 5 | player engines |
| 6 | player burners |
| 7 | flyby |

A sound of classes 5 and 6 plays on the one voice of its class. Any other takes a voice of its own
class that is free or borrowed, else such a voice of class 0, else borrows a free voice of any
class but 4, 5 and 6.

### Playing

`sound3d_play` (`0x0049D360`) takes a place and a direction, an owner, the sound, a volume and a
class; a further argument goes unread. It places the sound by what it follows, relative to the
camera and scaled by 0.0004 into Miles's units, its velocity by `1e-5` into a millisecond's. A
sound beyond its maximum distance is not started, but for the engines' (`PSHIP01` to `PSHIP12`) and
`BURNER01`. It decompresses the bank's ADPCM into PCM (`AIL_decompress_ADPCM`), since Miles's 3D
samples play PCM only, and plays it at the volume `Mastervolume / 127 × Fxvolume × share × volume`,
with the definition's loop count, cone and distances, at 22,050 Hz; the two explosions at
`18050 + 7000 × rand() / 32767`. Miles's `y` points up where the camera's points down, so every
place, direction and velocity goes over with `y` negated.

**Fix:** a sound that follows a shot, a missile or an object is placed by the owner's record, which
the game reads for an owner of -1 too, before the table. OpenReliant plays nothing without an
owner, or with one past its table.

Once a frame `sound_3d_update` (`0x00481BF0`) runs the engine's sound, then each voice playing. A
voice past its sound's length, `length / 441` ticks of 16-bit sound at 22,050 Hz, is freed but for
the engine's and the afterburner's. A shot's and a missile's stay where they started; the rest are
placed again by what they follow, and freed once beyond their maximum distance or once their object
has gone. Nothing gives an object its voice (`+0xB96` stays `0xFFFF`), so `missile_end`, which ends
a missile's, never does.

**Improvement:** a missile's voice follows it as an object's does, and is its own, so it ends with
it; it keeps its full volume half as far again (`sound3d.MissileSound.follows`).

### The player's engine

`sound3d_engine_sound` (`0x0049DCB0`) picks the engine's sound for the player's ship type:
`PSHIP01` on, by type; types from 244 count again from 0. The game starts it in three places: the
Reliant's and the Yamato's launches (`launch_reliant_run` at `0x0041B2AE`, `launch_yamato_run` at
`0x00419A50`), and the effect of a multiplayer respawn (order 121, `0x004B0DF2`). It starts it
again as the afterburner ends where the afterburner has no voice of its own (`0x0049DE94`).
`sound3d_engine_update` (`0x0049DCF0`) does nothing while the engine has no voice, and otherwise
keeps it going through three states (`0x0058CB04`):

- Idle: the engine's rate and volume by the ship type's row of the tables at `0x00508740`,
  `0x00508774`, `0x005087A8` and `0x005087DC`, at no throttle plus the throttle's share of what full
  throttle adds.
- Burning, while the afterburner or reverse thrust is on: `BURNER01` on the afterburner's voice, its
  volume growing from 5 by 0.8 a tick to 70, and its rate `12000 + 90 × that`, or 7000 in reverse.
- Cooling, once let go: the afterburner's sound fades over 25 ticks while the engine's plays on.

In view 13 neither is heard.

Both sounds loop until they're ended. As a mission ends, `mission_end` (`0x004942B0`) ends the 2D
sounds, then the music, then every 3D sound (`sound_3d_end_all`, `0x00481BA0`, called at
`0x0049436B`), so the engine stops with the mission. OpenReliant does the same as it lets the
mission go.

**Fix:** a player whose ship starts in space, or launches from any other carrier, flies the whole
mission without the engine's sound or the afterburner's, since the update does nothing until the
engine has a voice. The campaign launches the player from the Reliant or the Yamato, but missions 81
to 85 and 87, the multiplayer maps, and mission 99 start the player's ship in space, and a custom
mission can do either. OpenReliant starts the engine as such a ship comes into flight: as the
mission starts for a ship with no launch, and as the ship lets go of any carrier but the Reliant and
the Yamato, whose launches start it themselves (`sound3d.hearEngine`). Every start plays a mod's
ship type's own engine sound where it has one (`EngineSound`,
[Modding](../guide/modding.md#ship-types)).

### Ships flying past

The same update hears each fighter flying past the camera: within 10,000 units, not disabled,
hidden or exploding, at a throttle of 0.4 or more and moving at 100 or more, its velocity at least
a right angle from where the camera looks, or for a hostile one at least 41 degrees. A hostile
ship sounds `PASS01`, another `PASS02`, on a voice of class 7, no more than once in 500 ticks, or
200 for the player's own, which is not heard in views 0 to 3, 12 and 15. The frame it was heard is
kept at `+0x67C`.

## Music

`music_play` (`0x00482A80`) plays a file as a Miles stream at a level and a loop count, at once
where its `now` is 1 (`0x00482A9D`), or for any other value once the music playing has faded out
(`hog_snd.Sound.When.of`). The mission script's `PlayMusic` (`cmd_PlayMusic`) plays `music\` and
the name it is given, for ever, at level 80, its second argument the `now`. A piece the table at `0x005017A0` names
loops back to its own point, a byte offset into its data, once it has played through; the rest from
the start. The stream's volume is `round(((Musicvolume × level) / 127) × Mastervolume / 127)`.
`music_play` fades the music playing out with `music_fade_out` (`0x00482960`), which takes the step
it is given, 5 here, off the level every five ticks from the tick it starts on, until the stream
closes, and `music_update` (`0x00482C30`) then starts the piece waiting. `WinMain` fades the music
out by 15 before the hangar's movie of a mission it flies ([Movies](movies.md#the-hangar)). Mission 1 plays `new_launch.wav` as its
wing launches, and `new_searching mission 09.wav` once it is out. The CD player in the rooms plays
the pieces of its lists, and turns their level ([The CD player](cd-player.md)).

## Speech

`sound_init` allocates a sample for the radio's speech (`speech_sample`, `0x00563F18`) with two
buffers (`0x00563F20`), which `cbox.cpp` streams a line through: `speech_start` (`0x00461EB0`)
sets the sample up as 16-bit stereo at 22,050 Hz, both channels the same, at
`round(Speechvolume × Mastervolume / 127)`, which `sound_volumes_apply` sets again, and a timer
decodes the line into the buffers as it plays ([Speech files](../formats/speech.md)). OpenReliant
decodes a line whole as it starts and plays it on the sample
([`cbox.zig`](../../src/engine/game/cbox.zig)), which then goes through OpenAL Soft's resampling
and the master bus like every sound ([Sound](../port/sound.md)).

As a mission ends, `mission_end` stops the speech after the 3D sounds (`speech_stop_all`,
`0x004620D0`, called at `0x00494370`): it ends the eight streams and the speech sample, so a line
still playing stops with the mission. OpenReliant stops the radio's line there too
(`radio.Radio.stopSpeech`), and the next mission's start empties the radio's queue (`radio_reset`).

**Improvement:** the recordings push past full scale in a few samples of every thousand, which the
game cuts flat, and crackle; OpenReliant rounds the peaks off, unchanged within 0.8 of full scale
and eased toward it past that by a hyperbolic tangent (`cbox.softClip`). **Improvement:** the lines
ring in the cockpit's cabin, as Betty's warnings do, where the game plays them dry. `--original`
cuts the peaks and plays the lines dry.

**Improvement:** without a speech sample, as with `--no-sound`, a line still lasts as long as it
would play, timed by the game's clock (`game_ticks`), which stops while the game is paused
(`cbox.Player`). A line paused keeps the time it had left. Whatever waits for a line then waits as
long as with sound: the radio's window shows the speaker's face, and a scene runs its length in the
rooms, the induction, the briefing and the loadout. Otherwise each line would end as soon as it
started.

The crew in the rooms speak their lines on voice 2, an MP3 file each, which Miles's MP3 decoder
(`MP3DEC.ASI`) plays ([The crew](rooms.md#the-crew)). OpenReliant reads the frames
([MP3 files](../formats/mp3.md)), and FFmpeg's MP3 decoder decodes them.

## Where the sounds come from

- A shot the step hears (`guns.heard`) plays its gun type's sound following it, on a voice of the
  player's guns for the player's shots, of the guaranteed ones for the Huge Guns'.
- A flak shell plays `FLAK01` as it bursts.
- The player's ship warns, sound 1 of `betty.fat`, once a quadrant has lost its shield and half its
  armour ([Objects](objects.md)).
- A Huge Gun's shot striking a component plays `EXPLOSION01` where it strikes.
- A shot through to a hull plays `ARMOUR01` where it struck, facing the camera, or `PLAYERHIT` on
  the player's ship, following it, at most every 30 ticks (`shieldfx_create`, `0x004A0310`). The
  game plays `ARMOUR01` at the point in the part's own frame, taken for one in the world.
  **Improvement:** OpenReliant plays it where the shot struck.
- A shield generator whose part `node_draw` finds destroyed plays `SHLDDOWN` at the part, facing
  its way, and its object loses flag `0x4000`.
- Turning the missile ring plays `MISSILESELECT` at the player's ship (`hud_target_keys`).
