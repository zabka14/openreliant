# Documentation

Reference notes on StarLancer (Digital Anvil / Microsoft, 2000; developed by Warthog), on how OpenReliant reimplements its engine, and on the repository's tooling, derived from static analysis of a legally owned copy. The repository holds none of the game's files.

## User guide

The [user guide](guide/README.md) covers installing, configuring and playing OpenReliant.

## Other games on the engine

Other games on StarLancer's engine share its mission format. Comparing them with StarLancer shows
what a shared engine would have to keep apart
([#181](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/181),
[#1017](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1017)). OpenReliant doesn't play them.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`games/star-trek-invasion.md`](games/star-trek-invasion.md) | Star Trek: Invasion: its disc, archive, missions and models, which `sltool trek` reads. |
| [`games/battlestar-galactica.md`](games/battlestar-galactica.md) | Battlestar Galactica (2003): its disc, missions, command catalogue, stats, comms films, archives, models and textures, which carry StarLancer's game logic forward, and `sltool bsg`, which reads them and converts the models to glTF. |

## Conventions

Addresses are virtual addresses for the payload executable's image base of `0x400000` unless stated otherwise. The shipped binaries carry no symbols. Function and data names are those `make ghidra-annotate` gives the Ghidra project; names of the form `FUN_<address>` are Ghidra's placeholders.

Fixed layouts, in the game's files and in its executable's data, are `extern struct`s in the code, their fields the layout's own: enums for codes, packed structs for flag words, arrays for runs, with `comptime` asserts on the offsets. The readers view the bytes as those structs in place ([`formats/layout.zig`](../src/formats/layout.zig)), which needs a little-endian host; the few big-endian fields, the hog archive's and the mission script's jumps, are `layout.Big`.

Claims are marked where they are not directly verified:

- **Unknown:** not yet determined.
- **Unverified:** inferred from surrounding evidence but not confirmed.
