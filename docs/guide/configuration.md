# Configuration and options

Pass options when running `openreliant`:

```bash
./openreliant [<game-directory>] [<option>...]
```

If omitted, `game-directory` defaults to the current working directory `.`.

## The original

OpenReliant improves on the original's look and sound. `--original` turns the improvements off, and an option after it turns one back on.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--original` | The original's look and sound: 16-bit colour, one sample a pixel, bilinear filtering, lighting each vertex, light worked out on encoded colours, no shadows, motion that moves on with the game's ticks, a launching ship a frame behind the retainer that lowers it, lights from the latest shots only, muzzle flashes that light nothing and none from the turrets, a jump's flare that lights nothing, the force feedback's own effects only, a blow shaking the camera only while the controller rumbles, an explosion's debris lit by every light, its fireballs, rings, particles and burning bits as few, plain and brief as the original's, the Uber Explode as coarse, unlit and tied to the frame rate as the original's, a damaged ship's smoke as even as the original's, the shields' bubbles as coarse as the original's, the tractor beams as thin as the original's, the hangar's beacons falling short of the launching ship, a ship landing on the Reliant tilted as it came, its tube's door left open, the planets' atmospheres as coarse and fleeting as the original's and their terminators as hard, the Ice Field's rocks drawn only near the middle of the view, the loading screen's picture picked by the screen's width, the movies drawn at their size in the middle of the screen with Bink's blocks and its colour in steps of two pixels, the gates' tunnels as coarse as the original's, the ride through the worm rumbling the more often the higher the frame rate, the sun and its lens flares from their small textures and the sun's glow going out at once behind what hides it, the levels of detail changing as near as the original's, the marker for a target out of sight placed as the original misplaces it, a missile's sound left where it was launched, the radio's lines cut flat at their loudest and heard dry, Enriquez's last word in the briefing as loud as its recording, the loadout's ships and missiles solid, the interface's text in the game's bitmap fonts, and the sound mixed plainly in stereo |

## The mission

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--mission <number>` | Start this mission right away instead of opening the main menu. The number is the one in the mission's file name, `mission<number>.dte`, loaded from a mod, the game's `missions` folder or `resource.hog`. Mission 0 is OpenReliant's sandbox, which is built into `openreliant` for games without a mission 0 |
| `--ship <type>` | The ship type to fly, by its number in `shipstats.bin` or its name, such as `predator` or a mod's `teapot:teapot` ([The records](scripting.md#the-records)), in place of the loadout screen's choice, with its default missiles; the mission's own by default, the Predator in mission 0 |
| `--view <0\|1\|2>` | The view it starts in, as the game's settings keep it: 0 the cockpit; 1 the chase view; 2 no cockpit. The settings' own by default, which the settings screen's VIDEO changes, or 0 without them |
| `--difficulty <easy\|medium\|hard>` | The game's difficulty: how hard hits land on your ship, and shots on the enemy. By default, as in the game, medium with `--mission`, where a new campaign's starts, and easy in the main menu until SET GAME DIFFICULTY sets it |
| `--music <file>` | A piece from the game's music folder to play from the start, until the mission's script plays its own; none by default |
| `--no-pause-menu` | With `--mission`, fly the mission again as soon as it ends, where it otherwise ends in the game's pause menu |
| `--skip-launch` | With `--mission`, play the player's launch through without drawing it, so that the mission shows from the moment the ship is out; `--screenshot-ticks` count from there |
| `--part <name\|number>` | With `--mission`, run this part of the mission's script once the player's launch is over, as a trigger would. Name it by its number, or by its name or a piece of it in any case, as `sltool dte parts` lists them, such as `--part "antanov in"`. Give it again for more parts, up to 8, which run in the order given. The part runs where the mission is, so a part that needs ships from an earlier part may find them missing |
| `--watch <name\|number>` | With `--mission`, watch this ship of the mission once the player's launch is over and the ship is there, from a place beside it that moves with it. Name it by its number, or by its name or a piece of it in any case, as `sltool dte ships` lists them. It is the game's own watch view, with the bars of a cutscene and no head-up display, but it doesn't end the mission after six seconds as the game's does. The mission's script can still take the camera, and then keeps it |
| `--watch-from <x,y,z>` | Where `--watch` watches from, in the ship's own axes, in multiples of its size: `x` to its right, `y` down and `z` ahead. `1,-0.5,2.5` by default: ahead of it, to its right and above |

## Display

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--fullscreen` | Fill the display; Alt and Enter switch while playing |
| `--size <width>x<height>\|<percent>%` | Draw frames of this size in pixels whatever the window's, which shows them scaled, as for a screenshot larger than the display; or a share of the window's own, such as `50%`, to draw faster; the window's own by default |
| `--fps <rate>` | Frames a second at most; without vsync, the display's rate by default; 0 for no limit |
| `--no-vsync` | Draw without waiting for the display |
| `--fov <degrees>` | How far the views you fly in see up and down, from 34 to 94 degrees; the original's, about 64, by default. A wider window shows more at the sides |
| `--ui-scale <percent>` | How large the display and the pause menu are drawn, from 50 to 100 percent of the size the menus are drawn at; 80 by default, the original's size at 800 by 600 |

## Graphics

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--16-bit` | 16-bit colour, dithered |
| `--msaa <1\|2\|4\|8>` | Samples a pixel, for smooth edges; 4 by default |
| `--filter <original\|trilinear\|crisp>` | How textures are filtered; `crisp` by default (trilinear, sixteen times anisotropic, and magnified with a Catmull-Rom filter, or the nebulae with a smooth cubic one; the bitmap fonts' text is drawn crisp from its glyphs' coverage) |
| `--no-bloom` | Draw without the bloom around bright things |
| `--no-dither` | Draw 32-bit colour without dithering |
| `--no-pixel-lighting` | Light each vertex rather than each pixel, as the original does |
| `--gamma-space` | Light, blend and filter the encoded colours, as the original does, rather than in linear light |
| `--no-materials` | Ignore the material maps of mod textures: no normal maps, reflections or emissive glow, and the original highlights instead of the maps' highlights ([Modding](modding.md#material-maps)) |
| `--shadows <off\|low\|high>` | Shadows from the sun: low is soft and light on older GPUs, high sharp and smooth; high by default, and none without lighting each pixel |
| `--no-cockpit-shadows` | Leave the shadows out of the cockpit, keeping them on the ships |
| `--no-smooth-motion` | Move what moves on with the game's ticks, a hundred a second, as the original does, rather than on every frame |
| `--few-shot-lights` | Light only the latest two of the player's shots and the latest two of everyone else's, as the original does |
| `--baked-lights` | Bake the steady lights of ships and stations into their hulls, as the original does, rather than shine them as lights on what stands near ([Rendering](../engine/rendering.md#static-lights)) |
| `--launch-steam original\|soft` | The Yamato's launch steam: original brightness or softer jets with less glare. Defaults to `soft`; `--original` selects `original` ([Launches](../engine/launch.md#the-yamatos-launch)) |
| `--uncompressed-textures` | Keep the mods' pictures uncompressed on the GPU, as 8-bit RGBA, rather than compressed in BC7 and BC5: four times the memory, and a slower start ([Modding](modding.md#compression)) |
| `--bitmap-fonts` | Draw the interface text with the original bitmap fonts, scaled up to the window, instead of outline fonts drawn at the window's resolution (the built-in Newtown, or a font from a mod) ([Modding](modding.md#fonts)) |
| `--no-mod-effects` | Don't draw the mods' shaders: their post effects, their surface and lighting functions, and their replacements for OpenReliant's shaders ([Post effects](scripting.md#post-effects)) |

## Sound

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--hrtf` | Place the sounds for headphones whatever the output; by default they are while the output is headphones |
| `--no-hrtf` | Place the sounds for speakers whatever the output |
| `--no-reverb` | Play the sounds around you, the cockpit's voice and the Reliant's rooms without reverb |
| `--no-compressor` | Leave the mix's loudness as it is, only keeping its peaks in check |
| `--no-sound` | Play without sound |

## Other options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--no-mods` | Start without the mods in the game's `mods` folder ([Modding](modding.md)) |
| `--no-intro` | Start without the three movies the game plays as it starts, as `--mission` and `--screenshot` do |
| `--developer-mode` | The tools for writing mods' scripts: the scripting console, which F11 brings up where a mod has scripts, and folder mods' scripts reloading when they or their shaders are saved ([Scripting](scripting.md#the-console)) |
| `--editor-link` | Listen for a mission editor or a script debugger, such as `openreliant debug`, on this computer's own address, 127.0.0.1, which can then pause the mission and stop and step its script, as the original's editor link does ([Debugging mission scripts](debugging.md)) |
| `--editor-link-port <port>` | With `--editor-link`, the port to listen at; 22539 by default |
| `--screenshot <file.png>` | Draw one frame, with the camera settled, to a PNG, and quit; the controls, the `[OpenReliant]` settings and the details in `[Device]` are not read, so that it comes out the same each time |
| `--screenshot-ticks <ticks>` | With `--screenshot`, how many game ticks to run first, one a frame, so that the scene plays out; 2 by default |
| `--seed <number>` | Start each mission's random numbers from this seed, so that a run comes out the same each time, for testing; by default, as in the game, from the clock as the mission starts, and from a fixed seed with `--screenshot` |
| `--version` | Show the version |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the help page |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `openreliant install` | Install the game's files from the StarLancer discs into a directory |
| `openreliant joysticks` | List the joysticks and gamepads, and which one the game uses |
| `openreliant missions` | List the game's missions, its own and those added to its `missions` folder, and check that each loads |
| `openreliant debug` | Debug the script of the mission a game started with `--editor-link` plays ([Debugging mission scripts](debugging.md)) |

Each command's `--help` shows its options.

### Missions of your own

A mission file named `mission<number>.dte`, stored expanded, in the `missions` folder of the game's directory plays in place of that mission, as it does in the original: the game reads a loose file before its own copy in `resource.hog`. The retail game ships two, `mission18.dte` and `mission25.dte`. Check that a mission loads with:

```bash
./openreliant missions StarLancer
```

It lists every mission, where each comes from (`loose` or `archive`), and what its file holds, including the ship type and name of the player's own record, and says which fail to load. A mission can carry a name for OpenReliant to show, in a section of the file the original game ignores: see [OpenReliant's mission name](../formats/dte.md#openreliants-mission-name).

## In-flight keys

The flight keys are the game's own, as `starlancer.ini` binds them. Among them:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Escape | Open the pause menu |
| F1 | Open the controls ([Controllers and input](controllers.md#the-controls-screen)) |
| 1 to 8 | Camera views: 1 cockpit, 2 left, 3 right, 4 rear, 5 flyby, 6 target, 7 external, 8 missile |
| C | Open the radio menu, whose number keys call your wingmen and the base |
| F5 to F8 | Give orders to your wingmen, and request landing |
| 0 | Save a screenshot, a PNG in the `screenshots` folder of the game directory; O does the same in the briefing |

In the target view (6) and external view (7), arrow keys orbit around the object and Shift with Up or Down zooms.

OpenReliant adds:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| F2, F3 | In the sandbox, start it again in the previous or next ship type |
| F4 | In the sandbox, bring in another wing |
| F11 | In the developer mode, the scripting console, where a mod has scripts, in the menus too ([Scripting](scripting.md#the-console)) |
| Alt+Enter | Switch between windowed and fullscreen mode |

## Configuration file (starlancer.ini)

Settings are read from `starlancer.ini` in the game directory. If the file is missing, every setting keeps its default; if it exists but can't be read, the log says so. A change made in the game is written to the file straight away, and again as the game ends, so closing the window doesn't lose it. **Improvement:** the original writes the file over the old one; OpenReliant writes a new file and puts it in the old one's place in one step, so a crash or a full disk during the write leaves the old file whole. The game keeps its volumes, its view and its brightness there:

```ini
[Sound]
Mastervolume=127
Fxvolume=80
Musicvolume=80
Speechvolume=127

[Device]
View=0
gamma=100
Transitions=1
```

`[Sound]` keeps the four volumes, from 0 to 127, which the settings screen's AUDIO changes. `[Device]` keeps the view a mission starts in (`View`: 0 the cockpit, 1 the chase view, 2 no cockpit), the brightness in hundredths (`gamma`), whether the movies between the front end's screens and into the Reliant's rooms play (`Transitions`, 1 or 0), and the details, which take effect at the next start: the texture detail (`Tdetail`: 0 low, 1 medium, 2 high), the graphic detail (`Gdetail`, the same) and the light maps (`Lmaps`, 1 or 0). The settings screen's VIDEO changes them all. A screenshot taken with `--screenshot` draws at the highest details, whatever the file says. The controller's settings and the bindings, in `[KeyConfig]` and `[JoyConfig]`, are in [Controllers and input](controllers.md#settings).

### OpenReliant's settings

OpenReliant keeps its own settings in the same file, in its `[OpenReliant]` section, which the original game never reads. They are the options above, kept from one run to the next. Options on the command line change them for that run only.

```ini
[OpenReliant]
Original=1
Bloom=1
Samples=8
```

| Setting | Values | Option |
|---|---|---|
| `Original` | 1 for the original's look and sound; the settings below then change it. VIDEO's GRAPHICS writes it: ORIGINAL as 1, MODERN by taking it out | `--original` |
| `Fullscreen` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's FULL SCREEN sets | `--fullscreen` |
| `Size` | `<width>x<height>`, or a share of the window's own such as `50%`, which VIDEO's RESOLUTION sets | `--size` |
| `FrameRate` | Frames a second at most, which VIDEO's FRAME RATE LIMIT sets; 0 for no limit, and without it, the display's rate where vsync is off | `--fps` |
| `Vsync` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's VSYNC sets | `--no-vsync` |
| `FieldOfView` | Degrees up and down, from 34 to 94, which VIDEO's FIELD OF VIEW sets; without it, the original's | `--fov` |
| `UiScale` | A percentage from 50 to 100, which VIDEO's UI SCALE sets; 80 by default. GRAPHICS' presets and `Original` leave it as it is | `--ui-scale` |
| `SixteenBit` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's COLOR DEPTH sets: 16-BIT or 32-BIT | `--16-bit` |
| `Samples` | 1, 2, 4 or 8, which VIDEO's ANTI-ALIASING sets | `--msaa` |
| `Filter` | `original`, `trilinear` or `crisp`, which VIDEO's TEXTURE FILTER sets | `--filter` |
| `Bloom` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's BLOOM sets | `--no-bloom` |
| `Dither` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's DITHER sets | `--no-dither` |
| `PixelLighting` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's PER-PIXEL LIGHTING sets | `--no-pixel-lighting` |
| `LinearLight` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's LINEAR LIGHT sets | `--gamma-space` |
| `Materials` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's MATERIALS sets | `--no-materials` |
| `Shadows` | `off`, `low` or `high`, which VIDEO's SHADOWS sets | `--shadows` |
| `CockpitShadows` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's COCKPIT SHADOWS sets | `--no-cockpit-shadows` |
| `SmoothMotion` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's SMOOTH MOTION sets | `--no-smooth-motion` |
| `ShotLights` | 1: every shot lights the ships it passes; 0: the latest two of each side's, as the original; which VIDEO's SHOT LIGHTS sets | `--few-shot-lights` |
| `RealLights` | 1: the steady lights of ships and stations shine on what stands near; 0: they are baked into their hulls, as the original; which VIDEO's REAL LIGHTS sets | `--baked-lights` |
| `OutlineFonts` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's OUTLINE FONTS sets: the interface's text drawn from outline fonts, or in the game's bitmap fonts | `--bitmap-fonts` |
| `ModEffects` | 1 or 0, which VIDEO's MOD EFFECTS sets: whether the mods' shaders draw: their post effects, their surface and lighting functions ([Post effects](scripting.md#post-effects)), and, from the next start, their replacements for OpenReliant's shaders. GRAPHICS' presets and `Original` leave it as it is | `--no-mod-effects` |
| `Hrtf` | `auto`, `on` or `off`, which AUDIO's 3D SOUND sets: AUTOMATIC, HEADPHONES or SPEAKERS | `--hrtf`, `--no-hrtf` |
| `Reverb` | 1 or 0, which AUDIO's REVERB sets | `--no-reverb` |
| `Compressor` | 1 or 0, which AUDIO's COMPRESSOR sets | `--no-compressor` |
| `DeveloperMode` | 1 or 0; 0 by default | `--developer-mode` |
| `TextureCompression` | 1 or 0; 1 by default: the mods' pictures compressed for the GPU ([Modding](modding.md#compression)) | `--uncompressed-textures` |

The mods screen keeps which mods are on, and the order they load in, in a section of its own, `[OpenReliantMods]` ([The mods screen](modding.md#the-mods-screen)).

In the example, the game has the original's look and sound, but with the bloom and eight samples a pixel. A setting you leave out keeps its default, or `Original`'s where it is 1.

The settings screen keeps the graphics' settings so: a preset chosen with VIDEO's GRAPHICS is written as `Original` alone, and a graphics option changed after it is written only where it differs from what `Original` gives, and taken out where it is the same. As `Original` plays the original's mixer, ORIGINAL writes `Hrtf`, `Reverb` and `Compressor` beside it while OpenAL Soft plays the sound, so that the sound stays as AUDIO has it. A screenshot taken with `--screenshot` leaves this section out, so that it comes out the same for everyone.
