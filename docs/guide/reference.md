# Scripting reference

This page lists everything mods' scripts can use: the engine handlers, the packages, the fields
and methods of objects, the hooks with the fields each handler sees in `e`, and the names of
values. [Scripting](scripting.md) explains how to use them. `openreliant hooks` prints the list of
hooks, and `openreliant hooks <name>` one hook.

This page is generated from OpenReliant's code by `make definitions`, so don't change it by hand.

## Engine handlers

The functions a script returns in `engine_handlers`, which OpenReliant calls. Global scripts
include mission scripts.

| Handler | Scripts | When it's called |
|---|---|---|
| `on_init(data: any?)` | global, object, player and menu | When the script starts, with the data `add_script` gave it, or nil. |
| `on_save()`: plain data | global and player | When the game is saved, between missions, and as each mission of the campaign starts, for its restart point: what it returns, which must be plain data, is kept with it. Mission scripts aren't kept. |
| `on_load(saved: any?)` | global and player | In place of `on_init`, when a saved game is loaded or the game goes back to the restart point, with what the script's `on_save` returned then, or nil. A script that didn't run then, such as one of a mod added since, gets `on_init` instead. |
| `on_records_loaded()` | load | After every mod's load scripts have run. |
| `on_update(seconds: number)` | global and object | Each frame in which game time passes, after the ships' orders, with the seconds it covers. |
| `on_step()` | global and object | Each simulation step, 25 a second, after everything has moved. |
| `on_frame(seconds: number)` | player and menu | Each frame drawn, even while the game is paused, with the seconds of real time since the last. |
| `on_mission_start(mission: Mission)` | global, player and menu | When a mission has started and its first ships are there. |
| `on_mission_end(outcome: Outcome)` | global, player and menu | When the mission ends, for whatever reason. |
| `on_object_added(object: Object)` | global | When an object is added to the mission. |
| `on_object_removed(object: Object)` | global | When an object leaves the mission, such as once it has blown up. |
| `on_added()` | object | When the script's object is in the mission: as it's added, or at once if the script starts later. |
| `on_removed()` | object | When the script's object leaves the mission. |
| `on_key_press(key: Key)` | player and menu | When a key is pressed. A key held down is told once. |
| `on_key_release(key: Key)` | player and menu | When a key is released. |
| `on_action(action: string)` | player and menu | When the player uses the controls bound to an action, in flight. |
| `on_console_command(text: string)` | player and menu | When a line typed in the console isn't one of its commands, with the line. |
| `on_window_resized(width: number, height: number)` | player and menu | When the window changes size, with its new size in pixels. |
| `on_interface_override(base: { [any]: any })` | global, object, player and menu | When the script's interface takes the place of one an earlier script offered under the same name, with that one. |
| `on_option_changed(key: string, value: boolean | number | string)` | menu | When the player sets one of the mod's options on the mods screen, with its key and the new value. Options are set in the front end, so scripts that run in a game read them with `options.get` as they start. |

## Packages

What `require("openreliant.<name>")` gives.

### `openreliant.core`

OpenReliant's version, events for the global scripts, and game modes. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | string | The version of OpenReliant, such as `0.7.0`. |
| `game_mode` | string, or nil | The qualified name of the game mode that runs, such as `arena:arena`; nil in the game's campaign, INSTANT ACTION and anywhere else. |
| `game_mode_mission` | [GameModeMission](#gamemodemission), or nil | The mission the game mode that runs is at: the one flown, or between missions the one flown next. nil where no game mode runs. |
| `register_game_mode(definition: GameMode)` | string | Registers a game mode, which the main menu's GAME MODES lists. The mod's name qualifies its `name`, and the screen shows its `label` and `description`. `missions` lists the missions it flies in turn: each is the number of a standard `.DTE` file of the game's or a mod's, or a table that also gives the number the mission flies as, the names of its objectives, and its `hologram` and `last_word` in the briefing room. `ship` is the ship the player flies them in; without it, each mission gives the ship. With `loop`, the mode starts again after its last mission. A `campaign` shows the restart screen after a mission is lost or left, and carries on from the mission the player reached. `briefing` names the mod's registered screen that the front end shows before each mission. `briefing_room`, `reliant` or `yamato`, then briefs each mission in that game's briefing room, with the loadout. `loadout_ships` lists the ships that loadout offers, in order, starting on the first. `wing_pilots` lists the pilots of the player's wingmen, Alpha 2 to 6, in place of the campaign's wing, which the missions flown as the campaign's numbers give the wingmen: each a pilot of the game's by its number, or one a mod adds by its qualified name, and `none` keeps a place's pilot. With `debriefing`, the ITAC debriefs each mission that goes on to the next. `ending` names the mod's registered screen that the front end shows after the last mission. `records` names the mod's script that changes the records for the mode's missions alone: it runs as a load script before each of them, and its changes go back as the mission ends. Only load and menu scripts can use it, as OpenReliant starts. Returns the mode's qualified name. |
| `send_global_event(name: string, data: any)` | nothing | Sends the event `name` to the global and mission scripts, with `data`, which must be plain data. It arrives at the next update. |

### `openreliant.records`

The game's records: ships, guns, missiles, pilots, the pilots' faces, the text of the game and the ITAC, the campaign's missions in the order it flies them (`campaign`), and what the campaign makes of each of them (`missions`). Only load scripts can change them. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

Each of the campaign's missions, `missions[n]`, is a `CampaignMission` with these fields:

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `hologram` | string, or nil | The movie on the briefing room's screen, a Bink file from the game or a mod, such as `new_m01.bik`; nil for none. |
| `speech` | string, or nil | Enriquez's briefing spoken over the briefing room, a speech file from the game or a mod; nil for none. The briefing ends when she finishes. While she speaks, the movie plays on the screen without its sound, and starts over if it ends first; set `hologram` to nil for an empty screen. |
| `last_word` | string, or nil | Enriquez's last word after the loadout, a speech file such as `ms_speech\enrbr_tag01.ut`; nil leaves her silent. |
| `carrier` | [Carrier](#carrier) | The carrier the mission is flown from. The player sees its rooms, briefing room, loadout and hangar. |
| `objectives` | list of string | The names of the objectives, at most ten, which the mission's script numbers from 0 in `SetObjective`. Reading gives a new list; assign a list to change them, or nil for the names in the game's own table for the mission's number. |
| `date` | string, or nil | The date the launch shows, which is the game's text for the mission's number; nil for a mission the game has no date for. |
| `tier` | number, or nil | The loadout tier the campaign moves to when the mission ends, from 1 to 3; nil to leave the tier as it is. The tier and the pilot's rank decide which ships the loadout offers. The loadout before a mission uses the highest tier of the missions with lower numbers. |
| `chapter` | number, or nil | The chapter of the story the mission ends, from 1 to 5; nil if it ends none. The pilot gets the chapter's ribbon, the debriefing mentions it, and the chapter's movie plays after the landing. |
| `medal` | [Medal](#medal), or nil | The medal the mission awards for a success with its bonus, unless a nanny ship picked the pilot up; nil for none. The medal's ceremony plays when the pilot gets it. After a mission with a medal, the crew in the rooms honour the pilot, even if the pilot didn't get it. |
| `induction` | boolean | Whether a new pilot sees the intro and the induction before the mission, when a campaign starts with it. |
| `lesson` | boolean | Whether the mission's loadout teaches the player, as mission 1's does: it starts on the Predator with the tier's missiles, plays `loadout.ut` and blinks its exit button. |
| `only_ship` | [ShipType](#shiptype), or nil | The only ship the mission's loadout offers, as mission 23's offers the Shroud; nil for the ships the tier and the rank open. The loadout starts on it with the tier's missiles. |
| `television_report` | list of [ReportPart](#reportpart) | Enriquez's report on the rooms' television before the mission, as a list of parts that play one after another; an empty list for none. Reading gives a new list; assign a list to change it. |
| `debriefing` | [Debriefing](#debriefing) | Enriquez's debriefing of the mission in the ITAC: a list of paragraphs for each rating the mission's script can give. Reading gives a new table; assign a table to change it, and a rating left out has no paragraphs. |
| `news` | list of [NewsItem](#newsitem) | The news items that NEWS REPORTS in the ITAC adds in the rooms before the mission, and lists from then on. The news of how a mission went goes on the mission after it. Reading gives a new list; assign a list to change them. |
| `video_reports` | list of [VideoReport](#videoreport) | The video reports that VIDEO REPORTS in the ITAC adds in the rooms before the mission, and lists from then on. Reading gives a new list; assign a list to change them. |
| `landing_carrier` | [Carrier](#carrier) | The carrier the landing plays on after the mission, which picks the chapter's disc and zoom too where the mission ends a chapter: the Yamato from mission 18 on, the Reliant before. |
| `yamato_visit` | [YamatoVisit](#yamatovisit) | Whether the ship lands on the Yamato after the mission with a failure's thread and bank, whatever the rating: `never`, `always` as after mission 7, or `when_reliant_lost` as after mission 8, where `reliant_alive` is clear. |
| `chapter_reports` | list of [ChapterReport](#chapterreport) | The news reports that play after the chapter's movie, where the mission ends a chapter, at most eight. Each plays unless one of the game's variables in `unless` is 1, and then sets the variable `sets` to 1, if any. Reading gives a new list; assign a list to change them. |
| `alpha_5_pilot` | [PilotNumber](#pilotnumber) | The pilot who flies as Alpha 5 from the mission on, such as `diceman`; `none` leaves the pilot there as they are. |
| `alpha_6_pilot` | [PilotNumber](#pilotnumber) | The pilot who flies as Alpha 6 from the mission on, such as `bandit_volunteers_leader`; `none` leaves the pilot there as they are. |
| `wing_twins` | boolean | Whether the player's wing flies the `t_` twins of the player's ships, as in missions 14 and later. |
| `flying_tigers` | boolean | Whether the 45th fly as the 45th Flying Tigers rather than the 45th Volunteers, in the radio's films and in Moose's remarks, as after mission 13. |
| `second_part` | boolean | Whether the mission has a second part, `mission<number>1.dte`, flown once the first part is won, as mission 25 has. The second part has no landing before it. |
| `kamov_wing` | boolean | Whether the player's wing flies Kamovs, in the first part where the mission has two, as in mission 25. The Kamov's schematic is then drawn mirrored. |
| `close_ion_cannons` | boolean | Whether the ion cannons' lock lets a player's ship come much closer before it breaks, as in mission 28. |
| `hurried_turrets` | boolean | Whether the missile turrets wait half as long between launches, as in mission 28. |
| `ripper_from_below` | boolean | Whether the Ripper lifts an object from below rather than from above, as in mission 26. |
| `wide_advanced_gate` | boolean | Whether the advanced warp gates' tunnels are as wide as the prototype's, as in mission 8. |
| `counts_kills` | boolean | Whether the player's kills count toward the mission's tally, as in missions 1 to 27. |
| `terminate_ends_well` | boolean | Whether the mission's script can end it with `TerminateMission` without the ending counting as the player's ship destroyed, as in mission 28. |
| `fort_bear_ending` | boolean | Whether, once the Yamato is lost (`yamato_alive` clear), no landing plays after the mission, and a total failure ends the pilot's career in the shuttle at Fort Bear, as in missions 25 and 27. |
| `cobras_inquiry` | boolean | Whether the ITAC's history of the 705 Cobras tells of the inquiry into their colonel, as from mission 7 on. |
| `fifty_first_listed` | boolean | Whether the ITAC's squadrons list the 51st Volunteers, as in missions 1 to 9. |

Each of the KILLBOARD's pilots, `killboard[n]`, is a `KillboardPilot` with these fields:

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | The pilot's name. |
| `squadron` | string | The line below the name: the pilot's squadron, in brackets. |
| `ship` | string, or nil | The pilot's ship; nil leaves the column empty. |
| `kills` | number | The kills the pilot starts a campaign with. |
| `mean` | number | The kills each mission adds on average. |
| `spread` | number | How far a mission's kills can stray from the mean: half the spread each way. |
| `portrait` | number | The shape of the pilot's portrait in `inter\itac\kills.spr`. |
| `in_45th` | boolean | Whether the pilot flies in the 45th: the portrait takes the 45th's palette, and the squadron shows as the 45th Flying Tigers in the missions whose `flying_tigers` rule is on. |
| `joins_at` | number, or nil | The first mission the pilot is on the board in, as Linc Stevenson joins at mission 6; nil for every mission. |
| `leaves_after` | number, or nil | The last mission the pilot is on the board in, as John McGann leaves after mission 5; nil for every mission. |
| `sits_out` | list of number | The missions in which the pilot adds no kills, as Klaus Steiner sits out missions 19 to 23. |

Each of the combat maneuvers, `maneuvers[n]`, is a `CombatManeuver` with these fields:

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Its name, such as "loop the loop". |
| `mirror` | [ManeuverMirror](#maneuvermirror) | The inputs it may mirror: each time it starts, a random choice among them. |
| `min_ticks` | number | The fewest ticks it runs, unless the Fight order gives a length of its own. |
| `max_ticks` | number | The most ticks it runs: Fight draws its length from `min_ticks` up to this. |
| `script` | list of string | Its script: a command of the maneuvers' language on each line. Setting it compiles it, and a line that doesn't compile is an error. |

### `openreliant.hooks`

Handlers on the game's functions and events. For global and object scripts.

### `openreliant.world`

The mission's objects, the player's ship and the mission itself. For global scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `player` | [object](#objects), or nil | The player's ship, while a mission runs; nil between missions. |
| `mission` | [Mission](#mission), or nil | The mission that runs, with its `number` and its `file`'s name; nil between missions. |
| `objects()` | list of [objects](#objects) | Every object in the mission, in the order of their slots. |
| `missiles()` | list of [missile](#missiles) | Every missile in flight, newest first. |
| `set_player_target(target: Object, component: number?)` | boolean | Makes `target`, or its component number `component`, the player's target, as a mission's SetPlayerTarget does: the display shows it, and the player stops matching speeds. Returns whether it worked: false for a target the player can't aim at, such as a destroyed component, and between missions. |
| `set_primary_target(target: Object?, component: number?)` | boolean | Makes `target`, or its component number `component`, the mission's primary target, as a mission's SetPrimaryTarget does: the PRIMARY TARGET key selects it. Nil leaves the mission without one. Returns false between missions. |
| `set_objective(objective: number, state: ObjectiveState)` | boolean | Objective `objective` of the mission that runs, numbered from 0 to 9 as a mission's SetObjective numbers them, takes `state`, as SetObjective does: `hidden`, `listed`, or `current`, which the objectives window then shows. Returns whether it changed: false between missions, and in a mission whose objectives nothing names. |

### `openreliant.self`

The script's own object, as a handle: an object script's object, a missile script's missile, or the player's ship for a player script, nil between games. For object and player scripts.

### `openreliant.nearby`

The objects around the script's own object or missile. For object and player scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `objects(radius: number)` | list of [objects](#objects) | The objects within `radius` of the script's object or missile, or of the player's ship for a player script, nearest first, without it. |

### `openreliant.orders`

What the order table says of each order, the orders each object has, and ending them. An object's give_order gives orders. For global and object scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register(name: string, definition: {priority: number?, flags: OrderFlags?, init: ((ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> ())?, update: (ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> boolean?, exit: ((ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> ())?})` | string | Registers an order, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. `update` runs each frame on each ship that follows it, and returns false to end the order; `init` runs as it starts, and `exit` as it ends. They can't give or end orders. Returns the qualified name, which `give_order` and `orders.info` take. The order goes away when the scripts that registered it stop. |
| `info(order: string \| number)` | [OrderInfo](#orderinfo), or nil | The name, priority and flags of `order`: one of the game's, the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Nil for an order that doesn't exist, or a mod's that failed. |
| `stack(object: Object)` | list of [OrderEntry](#orderentry) | The orders `object` has, the one it follows first, each with what it's aimed at. The ones below carry on as each ends. |
| `cancel(object: Object)` | boolean | Ends the order `object` follows, as an order ends itself: its exit runs, and the order below it carries on. Returns whether it had one. Global scripts can end any object's orders, and an object's scripts their own object's. |
| `clear(object: Object)` | boolean | Drops all of `object`'s orders, as a mission's ClearAI does, where the one it follows gives way. Returns whether they were dropped. Global scripts can drop any object's orders, and an object's scripts their own object's. |

### `openreliant.radio`

Lines said on the radio, as a mission's comms commands say them. For global and object scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `say(ship: Object, speech: string, line: RadioLine?)` | boolean | The ship `ship` says the speech file `speech` on the radio, a file of the game's or a mod's such as `ms_dice22_001.ut`, its pilot's face showing, as a mission's CommsFromShip does: at once, ending the line playing, unless `line` says otherwise. The line goes through the `radio_say` hook. A ship being destroyed, or a stand-in, says nothing. Returns whether the mission's radio took the line: false between missions. |
| `busy()` | boolean | Whether the radio is saying a line, or has lines waiting to be said: false between missions, and where nothing is heard. |
| `say_pilot(pilot: PilotNumber, speech: string, line: RadioLine?)` | boolean | Pilot `pilot` says the speech file `speech` on the radio, with its face, as a mission's CommsFromPilot does: at once, ending the line playing, unless `line` says otherwise. The pilot is one of the game's by its name or number, or one a mod adds by its qualified name. The line goes through the `radio_say` hook. Returns whether the mission's radio took the line: false between missions. |

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `replaced` | list of [HudInstrument](#hudinstrument) | The game's instruments the mods' displays stand in for this frame, which aren't drawn (`register_display`). |
| `instruments_shown` | boolean | Whether the game's instruments show this frame: during a mission, in the view ahead from the cockpit. |

| `lights_lit` | list of [HudLight](#hudlight) | The status lights lit as the display last drew them, in the order it packs them: those of `lights`, but a flashing one only while it's lit. A warning that flashes keeps its place in the grid while it's dark; a light that `ShowHudIcon` flashes gives its place up. None outside the view ahead from the cockpit, where the display draws no lights, and outside a mission. |
| `charges` | [HudCharges](#hudcharges), or nil | The charges of the player's ECM, cloak and spectral shields, which their lights show as bars under them, each from 0 to 1, or nil where the ship doesn't carry the device; nil outside a mission. |
| `clock` | [HudClock](#hudclock), or nil | The mission's clock as the display shows it: the countdown where the mission counts down, and the time played otherwise; nil outside a mission. |
| `view_name` | string, or nil | The view's name the display writes at the top of the screen, in the views it names; nil in the others, the view ahead from the cockpit among them, and outside a mission. |

| `subtitle` | string, or nil | The line `DisplaySubTitle` shows near the foot of the screen in the director's view, whichever view it's in; nil for none, and outside a mission. |
| `speaker_name` | string, or nil | The name the radio's window writes over the speaker's face, while their line plays; nil while a line waits for the window, between lines, and outside a mission. |

| `open_windows` | list of [HudInstrument](#hudinstrument) | The game's windows that are open, opening or closing (`window_state`); none outside a mission. |
| `shown` | boolean | Whether it's shown this frame, which is when what's drawn on it shows, and its other fields can be read. |
| `width` | number | The window's width, in pixels. |
| `height` | number | The window's height, in pixels. |
| `register_display(name: string, definition: {frame: (seconds: number) -> (), replaces: { HudInstrument }?, layout: { [HudInstrument]: HudLayout }?, parts: { [HudPart]: HudPartLayout }?})` | string | Registers a display, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. While the flight display shows, `frame` draws it with this package's functions each frame, until it's turned off with `set_display_enabled`. A failed `frame` turns off that display only. `replaces` lists the game's instruments it stands in for, which aren't drawn while it's on, `layout` moves and scales the instruments it names, and `parts` moves, scales, aligns, rewords or hides the parts of them it names; they keep working, and go back as they were as soon as it's turned off, fails or its mod stops. Returns the qualified name. |
| `set_display_enabled(name: string, enabled: boolean)` | boolean | Turns the display `name` on or off: the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Returns whether it's registered. |
| `bounds(instrument: HudInstrument)` | [HudBounds](#hudbounds), or nil | Where the game's instrument `instrument` last drew, in the window's pixels, as the mods' displays place it, and even while one stands in for it; nil before it first draws, or outside a mission. |
| `part_bounds(part: HudPart)` | [HudBounds](#hudbounds), or nil | Where the part `part` of the game's instruments last drew, in the window's pixels, as the mods' displays place it, and even while one hides it; nil before it first draws, or outside a mission. |
| `window_state(instrument: HudInstrument)` | [HudWindowState](#hudwindowstate), or nil | How far the game's window that holds `instrument` has opened, and whether it's opening or closing, as the display last moved it on, which it does in every view; for the comms, the further open of its two windows. Nil for an instrument outside the windows, and outside a mission. |
| `picture(at: vector, file: string, size: vector?, style: FillStyle?)` | nothing | Draws a PNG from the calling mod at `at`, with `size` in window pixels (nil uses its native size), tinted by `style`. Files are cached for the script context; one that hasn't been drawn for 2 frames makes room for others when the cache is full. |
| `power_ball(at: vector, size: vector?, style: FillStyle?)` | nothing | Draws the power window's ball, turning with the player's power setting as the window's does, whether or not the window is open, with its top left corner at `at` and `size` in window pixels (nil for its size on the game's display), tinted by `style`. Unlike the window's, it doesn't shake when the ship is hit. Only during a mission. |
| `shape(at: vector, index: number, style: ShapeStyle?)` | nothing | Draws shape `index` of the game's sprite set for this layer (the flight display's, or the front end screen's), with its anchor at `at`, in window pixels. The style's `scale` multiplies its size in the game's pixels. |
| `text(at: vector, text: string, style: TextStyle?)` | nothing | Draws `text` at `at`, in pixels from the window's top left corner, in the game's font, as `style` says. |

| `rectangle(from: vector, to: vector, style: FillStyle?)` | nothing | Fills the rectangle between the corners `from` and `to`, in pixels, as `style` says. |
| `measure(text: string, style: (number \| TextStyle)?)` | [Size](#size) | The size of `text` in window pixels, as `text` draws it, and where its letters' pixels fall from the point it's drawn at: `style` is a text style, or just a number for its scale. |

### `openreliant.ui`

Drawing over the menus, the front end's screens and the pause menu, while they're shown: text, lines and rectangles, in the window's pixels. For player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `pointer` | [Pointer](#pointer), or nil | Where the pointer is, in pixels from the window's top left corner, and whether its left button is down; nil before it has been over the window. |
| `shown` | boolean | Whether it's shown this frame, which is when what's drawn on it shows, and its other fields can be read. |
| `width` | number | The window's width, in pixels. |
| `height` | number | The window's height, in pixels. |
| `register_screen(name: string, definition: {frame: (seconds: number) -> (), key: ((key: Key, down: boolean) -> ())?})` | string | Registers a screen, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. While it's shown (`show_screen`), `frame` draws it with this package's functions each frame, and `key` gets each key as it goes down and up. Returns the qualified name. |
| `replace_screen(screen: FrontEndScreen, name: string?)` | boolean | Makes the calling mod's registered screen `name` stand in for the front end's own `screen`, such as `"main_menu"`: while the front end shows `screen`, it runs and draws the mod's screen in its place, over its background. nil gives `screen` back to the front end. Only menu scripts can use it. Returns whether the screen is registered. |
| `go_to(screen: FrontEndScreen)` | nothing | Asks the front end to go to its screen `screen`, or to the mod's screen that stands in for it. Only menu scripts can use it. |
| `start_game_mode(name: string)` | boolean | Asks the front end to start the game mode `name`: the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Only menu scripts can use it. Returns whether the mode is registered. |
| `launch_mission()` | nothing | From a game mode's briefing screen, asks the front end to fly the mode's next mission (`core.game_mode_mission`). Only menu scripts can use it. |
| `play_movie(name: string)` | nothing | Plays the movie `name`, a Bink file of the game folder's or a mod's such as `"intro.bik"`, on a cleared screen, as the front end shows its next frame. Escape or the pointer's right button ends it. Only menu scripts can use it. |
| `quit()` | nothing | Asks the front end to quit the game. Only menu scripts can use it. |
| `show_screen(name: string?)` | boolean | Shows the screen `name`: the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Nil closes the screen shown. Returns whether it's registered. |
| `picture(at: vector, file: string, size: vector?, style: FillStyle?)` | nothing | Draws a PNG from the calling mod at `at`, with `size` in window pixels (nil uses its native size), tinted by `style`. Files are cached for the script context; one that hasn't been drawn for 2 frames makes room for others when the cache is full. |
| `shape(at: vector, index: number, style: ShapeStyle?)` | nothing | Draws shape `index` of the game's sprite set for this layer (the flight display's, or the front end screen's), with its anchor at `at`, in window pixels. The style's `scale` multiplies its size in the game's pixels. |
| `text(at: vector, text: string, style: TextStyle?)` | nothing | Draws `text` at `at`, in pixels from the window's top left corner, in the game's font, as `style` says. |
| `line(from: vector, to: vector, style: LineStyle?)` | nothing | Draws a line from `from` to `to`, in pixels, as `style` says. |

### `openreliant.input`

Whether keys are held, and the controls bound to actions. For player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register_action(name: string, definition: ActionDefinition)` | string | Registers an action, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names, and which the controls screen lists by its `label` for the player to bind. A default key or button that's already taken stays unbound. Returns the qualified name, which `action_down` and `on_action` use. Only menu scripts can use it. |
| `key_down(key: Key)` | boolean | Whether `key` is held down. |
| `action_down(action: string \| number)` | boolean | Whether the controls bound to `action` are held: its key, or its joystick button. The action is one of the game's (`Action`), the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. |

### `openreliant.camera`

The camera's view: which it is, switching it, and registering views of the mod's own. For player scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | string \| number, or nil | The view the camera shows: one of the game's (`View`), or a mod's by its qualified name; nil while no mission is shown. |
| `register_view(name: string, definition: {frame: (object: Object, seconds: number) -> {position: vector, orientation: Orientation}, letterbox: boolean?})` | string | Registers a camera view, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. `frame` gives the camera's position and orientation each frame; its axes must be unit length, at right angles and right-handed. A failed `frame` goes back to the cockpit view. Returns the qualified name. |
| `set_view(view: string \| number, object: Object?)` | boolean | Switches to `view`, looking at `object`, or at the player's ship where it's nil. The view is one of the game's (`View`), the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Returns whether it switched: a mission that holds the camera, or shows a cutaway, keeps it. |

### `openreliant.audio`

Interface sounds, music and Betty's lines. For player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `play_sound(index: number, volume: number?)` | boolean | Plays sound `index` of the game's standard sounds, the menus' and the display's, at `volume` from 0 to 1, or at its loudest where it's nil. Returns whether it played. |
| `play_music(name: string)` | nothing | Plays the piece `name` from the game's music folder for ever, in place of the music playing. |
| `say(line: BettyLine)` | boolean | Betty says `line`. Returns whether she does. |

### `openreliant.postprocessing`

Post effects: GLSL fragment shaders from the mod, drawn over the whole frame, before the flight display or after it. For player scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register(definition: Effect)` | string | Registers a post effect: a GLSL fragment shader from the calling mod's file `shader`, drawn over the whole frame. `stage` is `"before_hud"` (the default) or `"after_hud"`, `order` sorts the effects of a stage, lower first, and `parameters` holds up to four numbers its shader reads. Returns the effect's name, qualified with the mod's. A shader that doesn't compile is an error, with its file and line. See the scripting guide for what the shader reads. |
| `set_enabled(name: string, enabled: boolean)` | boolean | Turns the calling mod's effect `name` on or off, by its own name or the qualified one. Returns whether the mod has it. |
| `set_parameters(name: string, parameters: { number })` | boolean | Sets the numbers the calling mod's effect `name` reads, up to four; those left out are 0. Returns whether the mod has it. |

### `openreliant.shaders`

Surface and lighting functions: GLSL functions from the mod that change how surfaces are lit. For player scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register_surface(definition: SurfaceFunction)` | string | Registers a surface function: a GLSL function `surface` from the calling mod's file `shader`, which changes a pixel before it is lit. It draws on the `textures` it names, on every lit surface without a function of its own where `everywhere` is true, and on the objects given it with `object:set_surface`. `parameters` holds up to four numbers it reads. Returns the function's name, qualified with the mod's. A shader that doesn't compile is an error, with its file and line. See the scripting guide for what the function reads and sets. |
| `register_lighting(definition: LightingFunction)` | string | Registers a lighting function: a GLSL function `lighting` from the calling mod's file `shader`, which changes how much of each light reaches a pixel. One draws at a time: the enabled one registered last. `parameters` holds up to four numbers it reads. Returns the function's name, qualified with the mod's. A shader that doesn't compile is an error, with its file and line. |
| `set_enabled(name: string, enabled: boolean)` | boolean | Turns the calling mod's function `name` on or off, by its own name or the qualified one. Returns whether the mod has it. |
| `set_parameters(name: string, parameters: { number })` | boolean | Sets the numbers the calling mod's function `name` reads on its textures and everywhere it draws, up to four; those left out are 0. Returns whether the mod has it. |

### `openreliant.storage`

Sections of plain data for each mod: kept with the saved game, or in the game folder across every game. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `game_section(name: string)` | Section | The section `name` of the calling mod's storage that's kept with the saved game, and starts empty with each new game. Global and object scripts change it; other scripts read it. |
| `global_section(name: string)` | Section | The section `name` of the calling mod's storage that's kept in the game folder, across every game. Any script changes it. |

### `openreliant.async`

Timers, kept with the saved game: game time for global and object scripts, real time for player and menu scripts. For global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register_timer(name: string, handler: (data: any) -> ())` | nothing | Registers `handler` under `name`, for the timers of the mod's scripts of the same kind (and on the same object) to run. Register it as the script runs, so that a timer kept with a saved game finds it again after the game is loaded. |
| `after(seconds: number, name: string, data: any?)` | nothing | Runs the function registered under `name` once `seconds` have passed, with `data`, which must be plain data: seconds of game time for global and object scripts, and of real time for player and menu scripts. |

### `openreliant.interfaces`

The interfaces other scripts offer, as `I.<name>`: those of the global scripts to global scripts, those of an object's scripts to the object's other scripts, and those of player and menu scripts to each other. Nil for one nobody offers. For global, object, player and menu scripts.

### `openreliant.util`

Orientations, turning points between the world and an object's own frame, and angles. Luau's vector library has the rest of the vector maths. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `to_world(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | vector | The point of the world that `point` is in the frame of something at `position` turned as `orientation`: `point`'s x to its right, y down and z forward of it. |
| `to_local(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | vector | Where the point of the world `point` is in the frame of something at `position` turned as `orientation`: x to its right, y down and z forward of it. |
| `angle_off(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | number | The angle in radians between the forward axis of something at `position` turned as `orientation` and the direction to `point`: 0 dead ahead, pi straight behind. |
| `look_at(direction: vector)` | [Orientation](#orientation) | The orientation whose forward axis points along `direction`, turned about its Y axis, then its X axis, with no roll, as the game turns a ship to look at something. |
| `turn(orientation: Orientation, axis: Axis, angle: number)` | [Orientation](#orientation) | `orientation` turned by `angle` radians about its own `axis`: right-handed, so about its Y axis, which points down, a positive angle turns its nose to the right. |
| `angles(orientation: Orientation)` | vector | The angles in radians that `orientation` is turned by from looking along the world's Z axis, as the game reads them: x the pitch, y the yaw and z the roll. |
| `from_angles(angles: vector)` | [Orientation](#orientation) | The orientation turned by `angles` in radians from looking along the world's Z axis, as `angles` gives them: about X, then Y, then Z. |
| `normalize_angle(angle: number)` | number | `angle` in radians brought within half a turn either way, from -pi to pi. |

### `openreliant.vfs`

Reading the game's and the mods' files. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `read(name: string)` | string? | Reads the file `name` as a string of its bytes, the way the game does: a mod's copy (the latest mod's first), else the game folder's own file of that name, such as `missions\mission1.dte`, else the member of the game's `resource.hog`. Nil if there is none. |
| `read_mod(name: string)` | string? | Reads the calling mod's own file `name` as a string of its bytes. Nil if the mod doesn't have it. |
| `exists(name: string)` | boolean | Whether `vfs.read` would find the file `name`. |

### `openreliant.options`

The options a mod offers the player on the mods screen: declaring the page, and reading the values. For load, global, object, player and menu scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `register_page(page: Page)` | nothing | Declares the page of options the mod offers on the mods screen: a title and up to 64 options. Each option has a `key` that scripts read it by, a `label`, a `kind` and a `default`. A `"toggle"` has a boolean default. A `"choice"` has `choices`, each a `value` and a `label`, and a default among their values. A `"number"` has `min`, `max` and `step`, and a default in the range, and arrows step it. A `"slider"` is a number with a knob to drag, for a wide range. A `"text"` is a line the player types, of up to 24 characters, with a string default. A `"heading"` has only a `label`, and splits a long page. An option may have a `description`, which the screen writes under the list while the pointer is on it. Only load and menu scripts can use it, as OpenReliant starts, and a mod has one page. |
| `get(key: string)` | boolean \| number \| string | The value of the option `key` of the calling mod's page: what the player set, or the default. A toggle is a boolean, a number is a number, and a choice is the value of the choice set. |
| `set(key: string, value: boolean \| number \| string)` | nothing | Sets the option `key` of the calling mod's page to `value`, as the player does on the mods screen: a toggle to a boolean, a number to a number, which is held to its range, a choice to one of its values, and a text to a string of up to 24 characters. The value is kept, and menu scripts hear of the change (`on_option_changed`). |

### `openreliant.debug`

Lines and text placed in the world, drawn over the flight display where the camera sees them, for debugging. For player scripts.

| Name | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `line(from: vector, to: vector, style: LineStyle?)` | nothing | Draws a line between the points `from` and `to` of the world, as `style` says, where the camera sees them. |
| `text(at: vector, text: string, style: TextStyle?)` | nothing | Draws `text` at the point `at` of the world, as `style` says, where the camera sees it. |

## Objects

Scripts see objects through handles. A handle stays valid until its object is removed or its
mission ends; reading a field of a handle that isn't valid is an error. Every script can read the
fields; global scripts can change those marked *changes* on any object, and an object's own
scripts on their object.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `slot` | number | The slot it fills in the mission, from 0. |
| `type` | [ShipType](#shiptype) | Its type, such as `predator`. |
| `class` | [ShipClass](#shipclass), or nil | Its class, such as `fighter`; nil for an object without stats, such as a nav point. |
| `pilot` | [PilotNumber](#pilotnumber) | *Changes.* The pilot flying it, whose record sets how it flies and fights: a pilot of the game's by its number, one a mod adds by its qualified name, or `none`. |
| `side` | [Side](#side) | *Changes.* The side it's on. Setting it changes its side, as a mission's SetHostile does. |
| `position` | vector | *Changes.* Where it is. Setting it moves it there at once, as a mission's SnapToPoint does. |
| `orientation` | [Orientation](#orientation) | *Changes.* Where its axes point: to its right, down and forward, out of its nose (`openreliant.util`). Setting it turns it at once, its axes made unit length and at right angles first, the forward one keeping its direction. |
| `velocity` | vector | *Changes.* How far it moves in a simulation step, of which there are 25 a second. Setting it pushes it, and its engines carry on from there. |
| `speed` | number | How fast it moves: the length of its velocity. |
| `radius` | number | How far its model reaches from its middle. |
| `is_player` | boolean | Whether it's the player's ship. |
| `order` | string \| number, or nil | The order it's following: one of the game's (`Order`), or a mod's by its qualified name; nil for none. |
| `maneuver` | [Maneuver](#maneuver), or nil | The combat maneuver it flies while it follows the Fight order: one of the game's by its name (`Maneuver`), or one a mod adds by its number (`records.maneuvers`); nil while it follows another order. |
| `target` | [Target](#target), or nil | What the order it's following is aimed at; nil while it follows none. |
| `last_attacker` | [object](#objects), or nil | The object that last hit it; nil for none, or once that one has left the mission. |
| `throttle` | number | *Changes.* Its throttle: 1 is full, 2 the afterburner's and -1 reverse thrust's. Its order or its pilot usually sets it each frame. |
| `roll_input` | number | *Changes.* How hard it rolls, from -1 to 1. Its order or its pilot usually sets it each frame. |
| `pitch_input` | number | *Changes.* How hard it pitches, from -1 to 1. Its order or its pilot usually sets it each frame. |
| `yaw_input` | number | *Changes.* How hard it yaws, from -1 to 1. Its order or its pilot usually sets it each frame. |
| `afterburning` | boolean | Whether its afterburner burns. |
| `afterburner_fuel` | number | *Changes.* The afterburner's fuel left, in seconds of burning. Setting it fills or drains the tank, from 0 up. |
| `countermeasures` | number | *Changes.* How many countermeasures it has left. |
| `shields` | [Quadrants](#quadrants) | *Changes.* Its shields in each quadrant. Each can be set from 0 to what a whole ship of its type has; an object without stats has no shields to set. |
| `armor` | [Quadrants](#quadrants) | *Changes.* Its armour in each quadrant. Each can be set from 0 to what a whole ship of its type has, and its guns, speed and shields' recharge follow, as damage wears them; an object without stats has no armour to set. |
| `hull` | number, or nil | The share of its armour it has left, from about 1 as it's made down to 0: its weakest quadrant against a quadrant's full armour. Nil for an object without stats. |
| `invulnerable` | [Invulnerability](#invulnerability) | *Changes.* What can harm it: anything for `none`, nothing for `full`, only a player's ship for `player_can_hit`, and anything for `eject_before_exploding`, though its pilot ejects first. Setting it is what a mission's SetInvulnerability does. |
| `exploding` | boolean | Whether it has started to explode. It takes no more orders. |
| `ejected` | boolean | Whether its pilot has ejected. It takes no more orders. |
| `cloaked` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether it's cloaked. Setting it cloaks or uncloaks it, as a mission's Cloak does, where its model can. |
| `targetable` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether ships can target it. Setting it is what a mission's SetTargetable does: a type that can't be targeted stays so. |
| `lights` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether its lights are on. Setting it is what a mission's DisableLights does. |
| `disabled` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether it's left out of the mission's work, as a mission's DisableObject leaves it. |

| `missiles_disabled` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether it can't launch missiles, as a mission's DisableMissiles sets. |
| `engines_disabled` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether its engines are off: its throttle held at 0, and no afterburner or reverse thrust, as a mission's DisableEngines sets. |
| `eject_disabled` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether the player can't eject from it, as a mission's DisableEject sets. |
| `do_not_disturb` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether it keeps to its orders: it doesn't retaliate, come to another's help, rise to a taunt or take the wingmen's commands, as a mission's DoNotDisturb sets. |
| `avoidance_disabled` | boolean | *Changes.* Whether it no longer keeps clear of other ships, as a mission's SetShipAvoidance sets. |

| Method | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `is_valid()` | boolean | Whether the object is still in the mission. A handle stops being valid once its object is removed or its mission ends. |
| `give_order(order: string \| number, target: Object?, component: number?)` | boolean | Gives it `order`, aimed at `target` or at nothing, as a mission's SetAI does: the order goes on top of its orders if the one it follows gives way. `component` aims it at one part of `target` instead of the whole ship, as a mission's orders can: for Launch, the carrier's launch gate, counting from 0; for Dock, the port. Returns whether it took. Global scripts can give any object orders, and an object's scripts their own object. |
| `start_launch()` | boolean | Starts its Launch, as a mission's StartLaunch does: the first Launch among its orders goes after the short random wait the game gives each ship. Returns whether it had a Launch to start. Global scripts can start any object's launch, and an object's scripts their own. |
| `send_event(name: string, data: any)` | nothing | Sends the event `name` to the object's scripts, with `data`, which must be plain data. It arrives at the next update. |
| `add_script(name: string, data: any?)` | boolean | Starts the script `name` of the calling mod on the object, as an object script, and passes `data` to its `on_init`. Returns whether it started. Only global scripts can add scripts. |
| `remove_script(name: string)` | boolean | Stops the script `name` of the calling mod on the object. Returns whether it ran there. Only global scripts can remove scripts. |
| `hook(name: string, handler: (e: any) -> boolean?, filter: (Filter \| (e: any) -> boolean)?)` | HookHandle | `hooks.add`, for the calls that concern this object only: a handler for the hook `name`, with an optional `filter`. Returns the handler's handle. Global scripts can hook any object, and an object's scripts their own. |
| `set_surface(name: string?, parameters: { number }?)` | boolean | Draws the object with the surface function `name`, the calling mod's by its own name or any mod's by the qualified one, reading `parameters`; nil draws it with its textures' functions again. Returns false if no function of that name is registered. Only player scripts can set it. |
| `turrets()` | list of [turret](#turrets) | Its turrets: its guns that turn to aim, spin their barrels or launch missiles, destroyed ones included, in the order of its guns. |
| `parts()` | list of [ShipPart](#shippart) | Its parts, destroyed ones included, in the order the game numbers them: each part of its model, followed by the parts of the models that part carries, such as a turret's gun. Empty for an object without a model. |
| `attachments()` | list of [ShipAttachment](#shipattachment) | The attachment points on its parts, such as engine glows and missile hardpoints, part by part in the order of `object:parts()`. |
| `destroy()` | boolean | Destroys it the same way running out of armour does: a ship that lists components, such as a capital ship, loses its hull components, and any other ship explodes, unless its pilot ejects first. Returns false for an object that takes no damage, such as a nav point, and for one that is already exploding or jumping. Global scripts can destroy any object, and an object's scripts their own. |
| `destroy_component(component: number)` | boolean | Destroys its component number `component`, counting from 0, the same way a hit that takes its last armour does: the component blows up and takes the rest of its assembly with it, its damaged model shows in its place, and losing a hull part ends the ship. Returns false if the component is already destroyed, or the object is exploding or jumping. Global scripts can destroy any object's components, and an object's scripts their own. |

## Missiles

Scripts see missiles in flight through handles too. A missile's handle stays valid until its
flight ends or its mission ends. Every script can read the fields; global scripts can change those
marked *changes* on any missile, and a missile's own scripts on their missile.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | [MissileType](#missiletype) | Its type, such as `raptor`, or the qualified name of one a mod adds. |
| `launcher` | [object](#objects), or nil | The object that launched it, or let it fall; nil once that one has left the mission. |
| `target` | [Target](#target) | *Changes.* What it flies at. Its guidance turns to a new target from the next frame. |
| `side` | [Side](#side) | The side it's on: its launcher's, as it was launched. |
| `position` | vector | *Changes.* Where it is. Setting it moves it there at once. |
| `orientation` | [Orientation](#orientation) | *Changes.* Where its axes point: to its right, down and forward, out of its nose (`openreliant.util`). Setting it turns it at once, its axes made unit length and at right angles first, and its guidance turns on from there. |
| `velocity` | vector | *Changes.* How far it moves in a simulation step, of which there are 25 a second. Setting it pushes it, and its motor carries on from there. |
| `speed` | number | How fast it moves: the length of its velocity. |

| Method | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `is_valid()` | boolean | Whether the missile is still in flight. A handle stops being valid once its flight ends or its mission ends. |
| `detonate()` | nothing | Ends its flight now, as it ends when its time runs out: it blows up where it is, with a shockwave for a Havoc or an Imp. Global scripts can set off any missile, and a missile's own scripts their missile. |

## Turrets

Scripts see an object's turrets through handles too: its guns that turn to aim, spin their
barrels or launch missiles. A turret's handle stays valid while its object is in the mission.
Every script can read the fields; global scripts can change those marked *changes* on any
turret, and a turret's own scripts on their turret.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) | The object it's on. |
| `kind` | [TurretKind](#turretkind), or nil | What it is: `aimed`, which turns to aim at a target of its own; `spinning`, a gun whose barrels spin up while its object's trigger is held; or `launcher`, which launches missiles. Nil once it's destroyed. |
| `destroyed` | boolean | Whether it was destroyed with its base. It turns and fires no more. |
| `gun_type` | [GunType](#guntype), or nil | The type of the shots it fires; nil for a missile turret, or once it's destroyed. |
| `position` | vector, or nil | Where its base is; nil once it's destroyed. |
| `target` | [Target](#target), or nil | *Changes.* What it aims at: an aimed turret's and a missile turret's own target; nil for a spinning gun, which fires where its object points, or once it's destroyed. Setting it aims the turret, which turns to it, and nil leaves it to look for one. |

| Method | Returns | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `is_valid()` | boolean | Whether its object is still in the mission. A handle stops being valid once its object is removed or its mission ends. |

## Built-in interfaces

`require("openreliant.interfaces")` gives these groups of the packages' functions, unless a mod offers an interface of the same name. A group a script's packages don't allow is nil.

### I.Flight

| Member | Type or returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `to_world(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | vector | The point of the world that `point` is in the frame of something at `position` turned as `orientation`: `point`'s x to its right, y down and z forward of it. |
| `to_local(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | vector | Where the point of the world `point` is in the frame of something at `position` turned as `orientation`: x to its right, y down and z forward of it. |
| `look_at(direction: vector)` | [Orientation](#orientation) | The orientation whose forward axis points along `direction`, turned about its Y axis, then its X axis, with no roll, as the game turns a ship to look at something. |
| `angle_off(position: vector, orientation: Orientation, point: vector)` | number | The angle in radians between the forward axis of something at `position` turned as `orientation` and the direction to `point`: 0 dead ahead, pi straight behind. |
| `turn(orientation: Orientation, axis: Axis, angle: number)` | [Orientation](#orientation) | `orientation` turned by `angle` radians about its own `axis`: right-handed, so about its Y axis, which points down, a positive angle turns its nose to the right. |

### I.AI

| Member | Type or returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `register(name: string, definition: {priority: number?, flags: OrderFlags?, init: ((ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> ())?, update: (ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> boolean?, exit: ((ship: Object, target: Object?, seconds: number) -> ())?})` | string | Registers an order, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. `update` runs each frame on each ship that follows it, and returns false to end the order; `init` runs as it starts, and `exit` as it ends. They can't give or end orders. Returns the qualified name, which `give_order` and `orders.info` take. The order goes away when the scripts that registered it stop. |
| `info(order: string \| number)` | [OrderInfo](#orderinfo), or nil | The name, priority and flags of `order`: one of the game's, the calling mod's by its own name, or any mod's by the qualified one. Nil for an order that doesn't exist, or a mod's that failed. |
| `stack(object: Object)` | list of [OrderEntry](#orderentry) | The orders `object` has, the one it follows first, each with what it's aimed at. The ones below carry on as each ends. |
| `cancel(object: Object)` | boolean | Ends the order `object` follows, as an order ends itself: its exit runs, and the order below it carries on. Returns whether it had one. Global scripts can end any object's orders, and an object's scripts their own object's. |
| `clear(object: Object)` | boolean | Drops all of `object`'s orders, as a mission's ClearAI does, where the one it follows gives way. Returns whether they were dropped. Global scripts can drop any object's orders, and an object's scripts their own object's. |
| `give_order(self: Object, order: string \| number, target: Object?, component: number?)` | boolean | Gives it `order`, aimed at `target` or at nothing, as a mission's SetAI does: the order goes on top of its orders if the one it follows gives way. `component` aims it at one part of `target` instead of the whole ship, as a mission's orders can: for Launch, the carrier's launch gate, counting from 0; for Dock, the port. Returns whether it took. Global scripts can give any object orders, and an object's scripts their own object. |

### I.Combat

Returns whether it took. Global scripts can give any object orders, and an object's scripts their own object. |
| `start_launch(self: Object)` | boolean | Starts its Launch, as a mission's StartLaunch does: the first Launch among its orders goes after the short random wait the game gives each ship. Returns whether it had a Launch to start. Global scripts can start any object's launch, and an object's scripts their own. |
| `add_hook` | HooksAdd | `hooks.add`: adds a handler to the hook `name`. |
| `after_hook` | HooksAfter | `hooks.after`: adds a handler that runs after the function `name`. |

| `register_view(name: string, definition: {frame: (object: Object, seconds: number) -> {position: vector, orientation: Orientation}, letterbox: boolean?})` | string | Registers a camera view, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. `frame` gives the camera's position and orientation each frame; its axes must be unit length, at right angles and right-handed. A failed `frame` goes back to the cockpit view. Returns the qualified name. |
| `set_view(view: string \| number, object: Object?)` | boolean | Switches to `view`, looking at `object`, or at the player's ship where it's nil.

| `register_display(name: string, definition: {frame: (seconds: number) -> (), replaces: { HudInstrument }?, layout: { [HudInstrument]: HudLayout }?, parts: { [HudPart]: HudPartLayout }?})` | string | Registers a display, which `name` qualified with the mod's name names. While the flight display shows, `frame` draws it with this package's functions each frame, until it's turned off with `set_display_enabled`. A failed `frame` turns off that display only. `replaces` lists the game's instruments it stands in for, which aren't drawn while it's on, `layout` moves and scales the instruments it names, and `parts` moves, scales, aligns, rewords or hides the parts of them it names; they keep working, and go back as they were as soon as it's turned off, fails or its mod stops.

Unlike the window's, it doesn't shake when the ship is hit. Only during a mission. |
| `shape(at: vector, index: number, style: ShapeStyle?)` | nothing | Draws shape `index` of the game's sprite set for this layer (the flight display's, or the front end screen's), with its anchor at `at`, in window pixels. The style's `scale` multiplies its size in the game's pixels. |

| `set_primary_target(target: Object?, component: number?)` | boolean | Makes `target`, or its component number `component`, the mission's primary target, as a mission's SetPrimaryTarget does: the PRIMARY TARGET key selects it. Nil leaves the mission without one. Returns false between missions. |
| `set_objective(objective: number, state: ObjectiveState)` | boolean | Objective `objective` of the mission that runs, numbered from 0 to 9 as a mission's SetObjective numbers them, takes `state`, as SetObjective does: `hidden`, `listed`, or `current`, which the objectives window then shows. Returns whether it changed: false between missions, and in a mission whose objectives nothing names. |

## The game's functions

Each is a function of the original game, under its name. `hooks.add` runs a handler before the
function, and `hooks.after` runs one after it. Changing a field of `e` changes what the function
does, and a handler that returns `false` stops it.

### object_damage

Damage to `object` from `attacker`. Its shield in `quadrant` takes `value` first. What gets through, times `factor`, damages its armour (`object_armor_damage`). `kind` says what dealt the damage.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `quadrant` | [Quadrant](#quadrant) |
| `value` | number |
| `factor` | number |
| `attacker` | [object](#objects) |
| `kind` | [DamageKind](#damagekind) |

### object_armor_damage

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `quadrant` | [Quadrant](#quadrant) |
| `value` | number |
| `attacker` | [object](#objects) |
| `kind` | [DamageKind](#damagekind) |

### component_damage

Damage to one of the components of `object`, such as a capital ship's turret or engine: `value` from `attacker`, of `kind`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `value` | number |
| `attacker` | [object](#objects) |
| `kind` | [DamageKind](#damagekind) |

### damage_by_difficulty

How hard damage of `kind` lands on `object` at the game's difficulty: the result is what `value` becomes.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `kind` | [DamageKind](#damagekind) |
| `value` | number |
| `result` | number |

### object_destroyed

The end of `object`: its pilot ejects, or it explodes. With `may_spin`, it may spin out as it goes; with `no_eject`, the player's pilot doesn't eject.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `may_spin` | boolean |
| `no_eject` | boolean |

### bullet_fire

`owner` fires a shot of `gun_type` from one of its guns. `heard` says whether the shot makes a sound.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `owner` | [object](#objects) |
| `gun_type` | [GunType](#guntype) |
| `heard` | boolean |

### radio_say

The radio says a line: the speech file `speech`, its speaker's face playing the film `film`, as `mode` has it, at once (`now`), queued, or queued unless the radio is busy (`if_idle`). A handler can change the names, to say another line, or stop it, so that nothing is said and what waits for it goes on.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `speech` | string |
| `film` | string |
| `mode` | [RadioMode](#radiomode) |

### missile_launch

`launcher` launches a missile from one of its racks at `target`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `launcher` | [object](#objects) |
| `target` | [Target](#target) |

### missile_launch_turret

One of the missile turrets of `launcher` launches a Screamer at `target`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `launcher` | [object](#objects) |
| `target` | [Target](#target) |

### order_push

`object` is given `order`, aimed at `target`, on top of its orders. The result says whether it took: `"taken"`, `"refused"` where the object refuses it, the order it runs doesn't give way or it has too many, or `"conflict"` where the order it runs can't give way. A handler that stops the push leaves `"refused"`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `order` | [Order](#order) |
| `target` | [Target](#target) |
| `result` | [OrderPushed](#orderpushed) |

### order_pop

`object` ends the order it runs, which its exit runs for where it has started, and the order below starts again. The result says whether it had one.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `result` | boolean |

### fight_choose_maneuver

`object`, a ship under the Fight order, chooses its next combat maneuver, which starts on its next update. The result is the maneuver: one of the game's by its name (`Maneuver`), or one a mod adds by its number (`records.maneuvers`). A handler that stops it without setting the result leaves no maneuver, and Fight chooses again on the ship's next update.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |
| `result` | [Maneuver](#maneuver) |

### maneuver_run

`object`, a ship under the Fight order, flies its combat maneuver for a frame (`object.maneuver`): the commands of its script run until one waits. A handler that stops it can fly the ship itself.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |

### object_orders

`object` runs its current order, as it does each frame. Each order's routines have hooks of their own, such as `order_fight`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |

### vm_command

The mission's script runs one of its commands, `command`, on `arguments`: as many as the command takes, the first first, and 0 past them. They're the script's own values: numbers, and the places of the mission's ships and texts in its file. To change them, set `e.arguments` to a new list. The result is what the command gives: `"run_on"` lets the script's thread go on, `"wait"` ends its run until it runs next, and a number is the command's value, which lets it go on too. A handler that stops the command leaves `"run_on"`; one that stops it and sets `"hold"` has the thread wait, and run the command again, on the same arguments and through this hook, the next time it runs.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `command` | [MissionCommand](#missioncommand) |
| `arguments` | { number } |
| `result` | [MissionCommandResult](#missioncommandresult) |

### restart_screen

The restart screen, after a mission is lost or left. Its result is the player's choice: `replay_from_briefing`, `replay_from_launch` or `main_menu`. A handler that stops it chooses without the screen: `main_menu`, unless it sets `e.result`.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `result` | [RestartChoice](#restartchoice) |

### order_retaliate

`object`, a fighter, turns on whoever last hit it, once it has taken enough damage lately and its order allows it.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `object` | [object](#objects) |

## OpenReliant's functions

Steps that the original takes inside a larger function, which OpenReliant makes functions of its
own so that scripts can hook them. Handlers change them as they change the game's functions.

### mission_lost

A mission is lost or left, and `movie` plays before the restart screen. In the game's campaign, it is the pilot's funeral where `ending` is `destroyed`, the pilot in the enemy's hands where it is `captured`, the pilot's execution where it is `friendly_fire`, and none where the player left the mission. A game mode's mission plays none. `rating` is how the mission's script rated it, and `mission` is its number.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `ending` | [Ending](#ending) |
| `rating` | [Rating](#rating) |
| `mission` | number |
| `movie` | string, or nil |
| `result` | string, or nil |

### career_over

The pilot's career in the game's campaign ends after mission `mission`, and `movie` plays before the main menu: the pilot's transfer where `ending` is `rescued`, after too many pickups, and for a total failure (`ending` `total_failure`) the transfer or, after missions 25 and 27 without the Yamato, the shuttle at Fort Bear. `rating` is how the mission's script rated it.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `ending` | [Ending](#ending) |
| `rating` | [Rating](#rating) |
| `mission` | number |
| `movie` | string, or nil |
| `result` | string, or nil |

### medal_ceremony

Mission `mission` of the game's campaign awards the pilot `medal`, and `movie`, the medal's ceremony, plays.

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `medal` | [Medal](#medal) |
| `mission` | number |
| `movie` | string, or nil |
| `result` | string, or nil |

## The order routines

Each order an object follows, such as Fight or Run Away, runs routines of the original game:
an `init` as the order starts, an `update` each frame, and for a few an `exit` as it ends. Each
routine is a hook under its name. Its handlers see the object that runs the order as `e.object`,
and `e.object.order` is the order. Where OpenReliant doesn't run a routine yet, its handlers
still run, and the function does nothing.
