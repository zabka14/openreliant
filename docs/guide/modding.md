# Modding

A mod changes OpenReliant without changing the game's files on disk. It's a folder or an archive in
the game folder's `mods` folder. Its files replace the game's files that have the same names, or add
new ones, and its scripts can change how the game plays.

- [What mods can do](what-mods-can-do.md) lists every feature on one page, with an example mod for
  each.
- This guide explains a mod's files: how they replace the game's, and how to make each kind.
- [Scripting](scripting.md) explains scripts, and the [scripting reference](reference.md) lists
  everything they can use.
- [`examples/mods`](../../examples/mods) holds example mods, with comments in their files.

New to modding? Make [a first mod](#a-first-mod), then copy the example closest to what you want to
make and change it. The other sections can be read in any order, as you need them.

**Improvement:** the original can't load mods.

## A first mod

This mod replaces the main menu's music.

1. In the game folder, next to `resource.hog`, make a folder called `mods`, and in it a folder for
   the mod, such as `mods/my-music`.
2. Add a manifest, `mod.ini`, which names the mod on the mods screen ([The manifest](#the-manifest)):

   ```ini
   [Mod]
   Name=My Music
   Version=1.0
   Author=Me
   Description=A new main menu theme.
   ```

3. Add the files the mod replaces or adds, in the same folder. Here that's a WAV file called
   `New_Pensive.wav`, which replaces the main menu's music ([Music](#music)).
4. Start `openreliant` from a terminal. The log in the terminal lists each mod and what each of its
   files does ([Log messages](#log-messages)), and GAME OPTIONS, then MODS, shows the mod
   ([The mods screen](#the-mods-screen)).

OpenReliant reads the mods as it starts, so start it again after changing a mod. In the developer
mode, scripts and shaders reload as soon as they're saved ([Reloading](scripting.md#reloading)).

## Where mods go

Mods go in a folder called `mods` in the game folder, next to `resource.hog`. Each mod is one of:

- **a folder** of files, which is the easiest to work on;
- **an archive**: a `.hog` file in the game's format ([`.HOG` archives](../formats/hog.md)), which
  `sltool hog pack` makes from a folder ([Sharing a mod](#sharing-a-mod)).

```text
StarLancer/
  resource.hog
  mods/
    coyote/
      mod.ini
      mod.png
      USA_Coyote.SHP
    music.hog
    music.hog.sha256
```

A mod's name is its folder's name, or its archive's name without `.hog`: `coyote` and `music` above.
What the mod adds or registers is named after it ([Qualified names](scripting.md#qualified-names)).

A folder mod is read just as the archive packed from it would be:

- Its files must be directly in the folder. Files in subfolders are skipped, as `sltool hog pack`
  skips them, and the log says so.
- File names must be printable ASCII, like an archive's member names. Hidden files, such as
  `.DS_Store`, are ignored.
- A file that holds RefPack-compressed data, such as a file extracted with `sltool hog extract
  --raw`, is decompressed as it's read, like a compressed archive member. Movies and pilots' faces,
  which the game reads uncompressed, are read as they are.

`--no-mods` starts the game without any mods.

## The manifest

A mod describes itself in `mod.ini`, an ini file like `starlancer.ini`, in its folder or archive.
Every key is optional, and keys can be written in any case:

```ini
[Mod]
Name=Coyote HD
Version=1.0
Author=Someone
Description=The Coyote, remodelled.
Url=https://example.com/coyote-hd
OpenReliant=0.7
Requires=coyote-models
```

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Name` | The mod's name on the mods screen and in the log. Without it, they show the folder's or the archive's name |
| `Version`, `Author`, `Description` | What the mods screen says about the mod |
| `Url` | The mod's web page, where players can find it and its updates |
| `OpenReliant` | The version of OpenReliant the mod needs, such as `0.7`. An older OpenReliant skips the mod and says so in the log, and the mods screen leaves it out |
| `Requires` | The mods it needs, by their names in the `mods` folder, without `.hog`, separated by commas. The mod loads only if each of them is on and loads before it; otherwise it's left out, the log says so, and the mods screen lists it in red with the mod it needs |

The manifest's other sections list what the mod runs and adds:

| Section | What it lists |
|---|---|
| `[Scripts]` | The mod's scripts, by kind ([Kinds of scripts](scripting.md#kinds-of-scripts)) |
| `[Missions]` | The scripts that run with a mission ([Kinds of scripts](scripting.md#kinds-of-scripts)) |
| `[ShipTypes]`, `[Guns]`, `[Missiles]`, `[Pilots]` | The ship types, guns, missiles and pilots the mod adds, each described in a section of its own ([New ships, guns, missiles and pilots](#new-ships-guns-missiles-and-pilots)) |

The original never reads a file called `mod.ini`, so an archive with a manifest still works with it,
and the manifest doesn't replace any game file. Neither does the thumbnail, `mod.png`
([The thumbnail](#the-thumbnail)), a licence notice called `license.txt`, or a Markdown file such
as `README.md`. These belong to the mod, so two mods that each carry a `license.txt` don't
replace each other's.

## Load order

Mods load one after another, and a later mod's file replaces an earlier mod's file with the same
name. The mods screen sets the order ([The mods screen](#the-mods-screen)). Mods it doesn't list,
such as ones added since, load after the listed ones, in alphabetical order of their names, ignoring
case. Names such as `10-ships` and `20-music` keep that order clear.

Mods take priority over all of the game's files, including loose files, so a mod's `mission18.dte`
replaces the loose `missions\mission18.dte` in a retail install. Scripts start in load order too,
and the hooks of a later mod run first
([Order, removal and errors](scripting.md#order-removal-and-errors)).

### The mods screen

GAME OPTIONS has a MODS button, right of ABOUT OPENRELIANT, which opens the mods screen. It lists the
mods in the `mods` folder, with what each one's manifest says of it. A check box turns a mod on or
off, and the arrows beside the list move the chosen mod up or down the load order. The mods load from
the top down, so a mod replaces the files of the mods above it. REFRESH reads the `mods` folder
again, to find mods you've added or removed while the screen is open.

- CANCEL CHANGES puts the mods back as they were when you opened the screen.
- OPTIONS opens the page of options the chosen mod offers, if its scripts declare one
  ([Options](scripting.md#options)). The mod's scripts read what you set; the values are kept in
  its storage file, `storage\<mod>.data`.
- The changes take effect the next time OpenReliant starts. RESTART TO APPLY shows while the screen's
  list differs from what's loaded.
- The panel shows the mod's thumbnail ([The thumbnail](#the-thumbnail)), the mods whose files it
  replaces (REPLACES FILES OF), and the mods below it that replace its own (FILES REPLACED BY).
- A mod that won't load is listed in red, and the panel says why: a damaged archive
  ([Checksums](#checksums)), or a mod it needs (`Requires`) that is missing, off, or below it.

The screen keeps the order and which mods are off in `starlancer.ini` in the game's folder, in its
own section, one line for each mod: the mod's name in the `mods` folder, and 1 if it's on or 0 if
it's off. The lines are in load order:

```ini
[OpenReliantMods]
10-ships=1
coyote=0
20-music=1
```

The mods the section doesn't list are on, and load after the listed ones, in the order of their names.
Only 0 turns a mod off. To go back to loading every mod in the order of its name, delete the section.
You can also edit it by hand.

- A mod whose name has an equals sign, starts with a bracket or has spaces at either end can't be
  listed. It stays on and loads with the unlisted mods.
- The screen lists up to 255 mods, and leaves out the ones that need a newer OpenReliant
  ([The manifest](#the-manifest)).
- `--no-mods` loads none, and keeps the screen shut.
- A screenshot taken with `--screenshot` follows the section too, so it loads only the mods that
  are on.

### Getting mods from the catalogue

GET MODS, above the list on the mods screen, opens the catalogue of mods on the web: the mods that
[OpenReliant's mods page](https://openreliant.github.io/openreliant-mods/) lists in its `mods.json`
index, and those of any other repository you add ([Repositories](#repositories)). The screen lists
them like the mods screen does, grouped under the site's top categories (SHIPS, MISSIONS, ...); a
click on a heading folds the group, and another unfolds it. The panel shows the chosen mod's
thumbnail, version, author, full category, the repository that lists it, the OpenReliant version it
needs, its size and its description. INSTALL downloads the mod's archive into the `mods` folder,
checks it against the digest the catalogue gives, and writes the digest next to the archive as its
checksum file ([Checksums](#checksums)), so the archive is checked again each time OpenReliant
starts. UPDATE does the same for a mod that is installed in an older version, shown in gold in the
list, with the panel saying which version is installed and which one the update brings. A mod that
needs a newer OpenReliant is red and can't be installed. A mod you copied into the `mods` folder as
a folder is left alone, and the panel says so, since OpenReliant would load both the folder and the
archive. RELOAD reads the repositories again. One download runs at a time: INSTALL and RELOAD wait
for it. OK goes back to the mods screen, which now lists the installed mods. Like every change on
the mods screen, they take effect at the next start.

The catalogue and the downloads run in the background, so the menus keep working, and the panel
shows the download's progress. OpenReliant connects to the web only for this screen: to read the
repositories, and to download the mods you install. Everything is downloaded over HTTPS: a plain
`http` link is changed to `https` before it is requested, and so is every redirect, so nothing is
read in plain text, and plain HTTP never replaces HTTPS when HTTPS fails. Only a repository on your
own machine (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1`) is read over plain HTTP. The screen lists at most 127
mods. A download can't be cancelled yet
([#1040](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1040)), and the mods screen doesn't say
yet which of its mods have an update
([#1041](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1041)).

OpenReliant records the mods GET MODS installs in `starlancer.ini`, in the section
`[OpenReliantInstalledMods]`, one line for each: the archive's name, and the repository it came
from. A recorded archive loads only with its checksum file next to it, and only if it matches; one
whose checksum file is missing or doesn't match is listed in red on the mods screen as damaged,
like a damaged archive you copied in by hand. A mod you copied in by hand isn't recorded, and loads
unchecked when it has no checksum file. Delete a mod's line to treat it as copied in by hand.

```ini
[OpenReliantInstalledMods]
viper.hog=openreliant-mods
```

#### Repositories

A repository is a `mods.json` index on the web. OpenReliant reads the repositories that
`starlancer.ini` names in `[OpenReliantModRepositories]`, one line for each: a name of your
choosing, and the URL of its index, in the order the screen reads them.

```ini
[OpenReliantModRepositories]
openreliant-mods=https://openreliant.github.io/openreliant-mods/mods.json
mine=https://example.com/mods/mods.json
```

Without the section, OpenReliant reads its own repository, `openreliant-mods`, alone. With it,
OpenReliant reads what it lists, so you can add repositories, or leave ours out. An empty section
hides GET MODS. The screen lists the mods of every repository together. Where two repositories
list the same id, the first one listed wins, and the log names the mod left out. A repository that
can't be read is named in red above the list, with the reason, while the others' mods are listed.

#### The catalogue's format

`mods.json` is a JSON object with a `format` of 1 (the default when the key is missing) and a `mods`
list. A catalogue in a newer format tells the player to update OpenReliant. Each mod is an object.
`id`, `archive`, `sha256` and `size` are required: a mod that lacks one is skipped, with a line in
the log. The other keys are optional, and keys OpenReliant doesn't know are ignored, as the
top-level `generated` key is, which says when the index was written.

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id` | The mod's name in the `mods` folder. Its archive is named `<id>.hog`. A mod is skipped when its id can't be a file name, starts with a dot, is one of Windows's device names such as `con`, even with an extension as `con.v2`, or can't be a key of `starlancer.ini` (an equals sign, a leading bracket, spaces at either end) |
| `name`, `version`, `author`, `description`, `openreliant` | The same values as the manifest's keys of those names ([The manifest](#the-manifest)); `openreliant` is the OpenReliant version the mod needs |
| `category` | The site's category, such as `ships/fighters/alliance` |
| `updated` | The date and time of its latest release |
| `size` | The archive's size in bytes. The download stops as soon as more arrives, or when the server announces another size |
| `archive` | The URL of the archive, on any host. An `http` link is requested as `https` |
| `sha256` | The archive's SHA-256 digest, as 64 hexadecimal digits, with or without the `sha256:` prefix GitHub gives a release asset's digest. The download is checked against it, and it is written as the archive's checksum file |
| `thumbnail` | The URL of its thumbnail, a PNG ([The thumbnail](#the-thumbnail)) |
| `url` | The URL of its web page |

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "mods": [
    {
      "id": "viper",
      "name": "Viper Mk II",
      "category": "ships/fighters",
      "version": "1.3",
      "author": "Someone",
      "description": "The Viper Mk II, flyable.",
      "openreliant": "0.7",
      "size": 5624773,
      "archive": "https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant-mods/releases/download/viper-v1.3/viper.hog",
      "sha256": "9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08",
      "thumbnail": "https://openreliant.github.io/openreliant-mods/thumbs/viper.png",
      "url": "https://openreliant.github.io/openreliant-mods/mods/viper/"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Hosting a repository

Anyone can host a repository:

- Publish `mods.json` over HTTPS. A static site works, such as GitHub Pages.
- Link each archive over HTTPS, from anywhere: a release on GitHub, or any other host. Give its
  `sha256` digest and its `size`, which pin the exact archive the index lists, wherever it lives.
- Keep the ids unique: a mod's id is its name in the `mods` folder, and OpenReliant loads one mod
  of a name.
- Tell players to add the repository to `starlancer.ini` ([Repositories](#repositories)). To try
  it on your own machine first, serve the files at `http://127.0.0.1`, the one kind of address
  OpenReliant reads over plain HTTP.

The site generator of [openreliant-mods](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant-mods), in
`.github/scripts/site.py`, writes the index from the collection's releases, and can serve as the
example.

## How files are replaced

A file in a mod replaces every game file with the same name, wherever the game keeps it: inside its
archives or as a loose file. Names are matched ignoring case, and only the file name counts, not the
folder: a mod's `New_Pensive.wav` replaces `music\New_Pensive.wav`. A file with a name the game
doesn't use is added, so the mod's new missions or models can use it. Where the game has the same
name in several places, such as the stats tables, which exist both as loose files and in
`resource.hog`, or a picture that was saved twice, those are copies of the same file. Where an
archive has the same name twice, the game reads the first one, and that's the one the mod replaces.

| What | Where the game keeps it | For example |
|---|---|---|
| Models | `resource.hog` | `USA_Coyote.SHP` |
| Interface pictures, fonts and sprites | `resource.hog`, `CD1.HOG`, `CD2.HOG` | `brd2cd.tga`, `FONT.FNT`, `medal1.spr` |
| Sound banks | `resource.hog`, `CD1.HOG`, `CD2.HOG` | `betty.fat` |
| Music | `music\` | `New_Pensive.wav` |
| Speech | `ms_speech\msspeech.hog` | `ABRT_001` |
| Pilots' faces | `pilots\pilots.hog` | `45Tigers_Moose_D.fm8` |
| Movies | the game folder, `interface\`, `inter\`, `CD1.HOG`, `CD2.HOG` | `New_nms.bik`, `int.bik` |
| Missions | `missions\`, `resource.hog` | `mission1.dte` |
| Stats tables | the game folder | `shipstats.bin` |

Names have no folders, so give the files your mod adds a unique prefix, such as the mod's name, to
keep them from clashing with another mod's files. A file that `mod.ini` names with a folder in
front, written with `\` or `/`, such as `EngineSound=sounds\peel.wav`, is found by its own name, on
every system: models, sounds, pictures and face films alike.
`sltool hog ls <archive>` lists the files in an archive, and `sltool hog extract` extracts them
([Tools](#tools)).

### Formats

A mod's files use the game's formats, which the [developer documentation](../README.md) describes,
and a few modern ones beside them:

| What | Formats | Made with |
|---|---|---|
| Models | `.shp` | `sltool shp from-obj` or `sltool shp from-gltf` ([Models](#models)) |
| Textures | PNG at any size, or DDS and KTX2 files compressed already | An image editor ([Textures](#textures)) |
| Interface shapes and pictures | PNG at any size | An image editor ([The interface](#the-interface)) |
| Interface fonts | `.fnt`, TrueType or OpenType | A font editor ([Fonts](#fonts)) |
| Music | WAV, 16-bit PCM or IMA ADPCM, at any rate | An audio editor ([Music](#music)) |
| A mod's engine and gun sounds | WAV, PCM or IMA ADPCM | An audio editor ([Ship types](#ship-types), [Guns](#guns)) |
| Lines of speech | WAV (16-bit or 8-bit PCM, or IMA ADPCM) or MP3, at any rate, mono or stereo; or the game's speech files | An audio editor, or `sltool speech encode` from WAV ([Lines](#lines)) |
| Pilots' faces | `.fm8` face films | `sltool fm8 encode`, from PNG frames ([Faces](#faces)) |
| Missions | `.dte` | A mission editor ([Missions](#missions)) |
| Stats tables | `.bin` | Better changed from a load script ([The records](scripting.md#the-records)) |
| Sound banks | `.fat` | No tool yet: `sltool fat extract` saves a bank's sounds, but can't build a bank |
| Movies | Bink (`.bik`) | RAD Game Tools' Bink tools |

Sounds, music and movies in today's formats are planned
([#496](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/496)), as are lines in FLAC, Ogg Vorbis
or Opus.

### Music

A piece of music is a WAV file, 16-bit PCM or IMA ADPCM, at any rate. Where the game's piece loops
back to a point partway through, so does the mod's, at the same moment of the music whatever its
format: make it the same length as the game's, or at least as long as its loop point, to keep the
loop where the game has it. If the game's piece can't be read, the mod's loops back to the game
file's byte offset, which may be the wrong moment, and the log says so.

## Textures

Model and effect textures come from the texture cache, `tcachehw.dat` ([Texture
caches](../formats/tcache.md)). Each has a name without an extension, such as `yank_2`, the Coyote's
hull. To replace a texture, add a PNG file with its name, `yank_2.png`, at any size, with an alpha
channel if it needs one. `sltool tcache ls tcachehw.dat` lists the names and sizes, and `sltool
tcache extract tcachehw.dat palette.tga textures yank_2` saves a texture as a PNG with its name and
original size, which you can use as a template.

- A picture must follow the model's texture coordinates, so keep the layout of the template, just
  with more pixels. The whole picture covers the same area as the whole original texture.
- Keep the template's proportions and use a whole multiple of its size: a 256x128 texture becomes
  1024x512 or 2048x1024. A picture with other proportions is stretched over the model.
- OpenReliant generates the mipmaps when it loads the picture (each level half the size of the last,
  down to one pixel, computed in linear light and weighted by alpha), so you don't need to provide
  them.
- A side longer than 8192 pixels is halved until it fits, since every GPU supports that size.
- 2048x2048 is enough for a fighter.

### Compression

Where the GPU takes compressed textures, as desktop GPUs do, OpenReliant compresses mods' pictures
as today's games do: colours, material maps and emissive maps in BC7, normal maps in BC5. A
4096x4096 picture then
takes about 21 MB of GPU memory with its mipmaps, a quarter of the 85 MB it takes uncompressed, and
the computer lets go of its own copy once the GPU holds it.

- Compressing a large picture takes a few seconds, once. The result is kept in the game folder's
  `cache/textures`, one file for each texture, and later starts read it in a moment. A changed
  picture, or another texture detail, compresses again. The folder can be deleted at any time.
- A normal map keeps only two channels, x and y, in BC5 and uncompressed alike, so the extra value
  OpenReliant keeps for each normal map pixel (how much the normals spread out, which widens the
  highlights on fine details) moves to the material map's alpha channel.
- A 16-bit normal map is compressed from its 16 bits, which keeps more of a shallow slope than an
  8-bit picture can ([16-bit normal maps](#16-bit-normal-maps)).
- `TextureCompression=0` in `starlancer.ini`, or `--uncompressed-textures`, keeps the pictures as
  they are ([Configuration](configuration.md)).

A picture or a map can also come compressed already, in a DDS (`.dds`) or KTX2 (`.ktx2`) file with
the same name, which OpenReliant looks for before the PNG file: `yank_2.dds`, `yank_2_normal.dds`.
It reads a single 2D picture with its mipmaps, in BC1, BC3, BC5 or BC7, or uncompressed 8-bit RGBA.
A KTX2 file can be supercompressed with Zstandard (`toktx --zcmp`), but not hold Basis Universal
data ([#637](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/637)). Its colours are taken as
sRGB-encoded, as a PNG's are.

- A compressed file draws as it is, so it starts as fast as a cached one. Give it its mipmaps:
  OpenReliant can't make them from compressed pixels.
- Beside a compressed picture, a normal map in BC5 and a material map in BC7 are used as they are,
  and a PNG map is compressed to match. A map in another format is left out, which the log says.
- A map needs at least as many mipmap levels as its picture. Extra levels are dropped, and a map
  with fewer is left out, which the log says. A PNG file always has them all.
- A compressed picture needs a GPU that takes its format. Elsewhere, it is left out, and the
  cache's own texture is drawn.

**Improvement:** the original only uses the textures in its cache, at most 256x256.

### Textures in the loadout

The loadout draws the ships in green and the missiles and guns in red. The game keeps a green and a
red copy of each ship texture, named with a `g` or an `r` in front: `gyank_2` and `ryank_2` for
`yank_2`. Don't make them for your mod: OpenReliant makes the copies of your pictures as it runs,
in the same shades as the game's copies, and passes over any copy a mod gives, such as
`gyank_2.png`. A picture that comes compressed already, in a DDS or KTX2 file, can't be turned
green or red; the loadout then draws the game's own copy, where the game has the texture.

## Material maps

A texture can come with the extra maps that modern tools produce, which describe the surface's
material, such as metal or paint, rough or polished. They follow the metallic workflow used by glTF
2.0, Blender and most engines:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `yank_2_normal.png` | The surface normals, in OpenGL's convention: green points to the top of the picture |
| `yank_2_orm.png` | Occlusion, roughness and metallic in the red, green and blue channels, as in glTF |
| `yank_2_occlusion.png`, `yank_2_roughness.png`, `yank_2_metallic.png` | The same three as separate greyscale pictures, if there's no `_orm` map |
| `yank_2_emissive.png` | The light the surface gives off by itself, such as glowing vents or lit windows, in colour, as glTF's emissive texture: black where it gives off none |

Each map must be the same size as its texture, and any of them can be left out: a normal map on its
own adds surface detail to the lighting, a material map on its own gives the surface its
highlights, and an emissive map on its own makes parts of it glow. Without a map, the surface is
treated as flat, without occlusion, rough, non-metallic and giving off no light. Normal and material
maps hold linear values, not colours, and their mipmaps are computed that way. An emissive map holds
colours, like the texture itself. For normal maps, each mipmap level renormalizes the normals and
keeps how much the normals it averages spread out, so the alpha channel of a normal map is ignored.

OpenReliant lights each pixel according to the maps:

- The normal map tilts each pixel's normal. The models have no tangents, so OpenReliant works out
  the texture's directions on the surface for each pixel. Ambient light gets darker the more the
  normal is tilted away from the surface, so grooves and edges also show on the side facing away
  from the lights.
- The material map sets the highlights each light makes, from the surface's roughness and metalness,
  and metals tint them with their colour. This replaces the original's highlight pass.
- Surfaces reflect their surroundings, the sky and the nebula, blurred according to the roughness:
  smooth glass reflects the nebula clearly at glancing angles, and polished metal reflects it
  everywhere.
- Occlusion darkens the ambient light and the reflections.
- Where the normal map has details smaller than a pixel, the surface looks correspondingly rougher
  (Toksvig's method), instead of its highlights sparkling.
- The emissive map's colour is added once the pixel is lit: on the dark side of a ship it shows as
  painted, and on the lit side it brightens the surface. Keep it dark and soft for a gentle glow; a
  bright emissive map washes the surface out. The loadout draws its ships and weapons without their
  emissive maps.

The base texture should hold only the surface's colour, with no shading painted in, or the lighting
will show twice. The MATERIALS setting under VIDEO and `--no-materials` turn the maps off, as
`--original` does.

For metals, the base colour sets how much light the metal reflects, and tints its highlights and
reflections. Real metals reflect at least half the light: steel about 56 percent and aluminium about
91, which is about 180 to 255 in sRGB. A metal painted darker than that reflects too little to look
right. Put dirt and wear in the roughness map, or make those areas non-metallic in the metallic map,
instead of darkening the colour.

**Improvement:** the original lights every surface the same way, with a highlight pass on top, and
only its light maps make a surface glow.

### 16-bit normal maps

A normal map can be a 16-bit PNG, as Blender, Substance and most baking tools can write it.
OpenReliant keeps its 16 bits: a very shallow slope, such as a gently curved plate or a soft dent,
then lights smoothly instead of in bands. An 8-bit normal map has only 256 steps in each direction,
so a slope that changes by less than a step across many pixels comes out in stripes.

- Uncompressed, the normal map's x and y stay at 16 bits on the GPU, which takes no more memory
  than an 8-bit normal map.
- Compressed, OpenReliant makes the BC5 blocks from the 16-bit values. BC5 holds values between
  its 8-bit endpoints finer than 8 bits, so a shallow slope keeps much of its smoothness.
- Only normal maps are read at 16 bits. Other 16-bit pictures are read at 8 bits, which is all
  that colours, material maps and emissive maps need.

## The interface

The interface draws its graphics from sprite sets ([`.SPR` sprites](../formats/spr.md)): the flight
display from `HUDHARD.SPR`, each screen from its own set, and each ship's schematic (shown on the
display for the player's ship and the target) from a set such as `ARCHSCEM.SPR`. The screen
backgrounds are TGA pictures. A mod can replace either with a PNG picture of any size.

### Shapes

To replace a shape, add a PNG named the way `sltool spr extract` names it: the set's name, `_`, the
shape's number in the set with at least three digits, and `.png`. For example, `HUDHARD_127.png` is
the targeting cluster's arc. Use the extracted picture as a template:

```bash
sltool hog extract resource.hog files           # the sprite sets, among other files
sltool spr ls files/HUDHARD.SPR                 # each shape's number and size
sltool spr extract files/HUDHARD.SPR shapes     # each shape as a picture at its original size
```

- **Size and proportions.** A picture is drawn over the same rectangle as the original shape,
  whatever its size. Keep the template's proportions and use a whole multiple of its size: the
  68x141 arc becomes 272x564 at four times the size. A picture with other proportions is stretched
  to fit.
- **Layout.** The game positions shapes by that rectangle, so keep the art where the template has
  it: art moved within the picture moves on screen, and art outside the template's edges gets
  squeezed in. The template's margins are all the room there is. Shapes drawn on top of each other
  must keep matching layouts: a ship's schematic (shape 0) and the hit markers on its four quadrants
  (shapes 1 to 4), which flash over it; or a gauge's unlit shape and the lit shape drawn over it up
  to the current level, such as the speed gauge, `HUDHARD_185.png` and `HUDHARD_184.png`.
- **One picture, several places.** The game draws some shapes mirrored, such as the targeting
  cluster's right arc, which is the left one flipped, and some in several places. One picture covers
  all of them. A shape the game draws in several colours is a separate shape for each colour, each
  with its own picture.
- **Alpha and colour.** The template is transparent around the shape, and the picture's alpha
  channel is used, including soft edges. Pictures keep their colours, but are dimmed where the game
  dims the shape, such as a menu item that can't be selected.
- **Resolution.** The menus, briefing, ITAC and loadout screens are designed for 640x480, and each
  is scaled to fit the window. The flight display and the pause menu are drawn at VIDEO's UI SCALE,
  a share of that size, 80 percent by default and 100 at most, as in the table below. A picture is
  sharp when it's as many times larger than the template as the window scales it: four times is
  enough for the flight display up to 3840x2160 at the default UI SCALE, and for the 640x480 screens
  up to 2560x1440. Larger pictures gain nothing, and cost memory and loading time, which delays the
  first frame that shows them.

| Window | Flight display and pause menu, at 80% | 640x480 screens, and the display at 100% |
|---|---|---|
| 1920x1080 | 1.8 times | 2.25 times |
| 2560x1440 | 2.4 times | 3 times |
| 3840x2160 | 3.6 times | 4.5 times |

### Pictures

The screen backgrounds, the ITAC's pictures, the briefing door and the loading screens are TGA
files, as is the loadout's backdrop. To replace one, add a PNG with its name, such as
`sl_splash2.png` for `interface\sl_splash2.tga`, at any size.

- **Size and proportions.** A picture is scaled to the screen's height, keeping its proportions, and
  centred horizontally. The game's pictures are 4:3, mostly 640x480 (the loading screens have larger
  versions), so a 4:3 picture such as 1280x960, 2560x1920 or 2880x2160 covers the screen the same
  way.
- **Widescreen.** A wider picture extends past the sides of the screen in a wider window: a 16:9
  picture, such as 1920x1080 or 3840x2160, fills a 16:9 window, where the game's pictures leave bars
  at the sides. Its middle 4:3 area (1440x1080 of 1920x1080) sits behind the screen, whose shapes,
  buttons and text stay where the game puts them, so put the important art in the middle and use the
  sides for scenery. A narrower window cuts off the sides, and a window wider than the picture shows
  bars beyond it.
- **Opaque.** Pictures are drawn without their alpha channel, like the original pictures.

A few TGA pictures are read pixel by pixel at their original size. A PNG replaces one of these only
if it has the same size; otherwise it's skipped, with a message in the log
([#509](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/509)):

| Picture | Size | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `fpanels.tga` | 256x256 | The loadout's panels |
| `powerball.tga` | 256x256 | The flight display's power ball |
| `space.tga` | 360x360 | The star map |
| `starref12.tga` | 256x256 | The sky colours |

**Improvement:** the original only draws its interface pictures at their original size, and
stretches its backgrounds to fit the screen.

### Fonts

The interface uses bitmap fonts made for 640x480 ([`.fnt` fonts](../formats/fnt.md)). A mod can
replace one with a TrueType or OpenType font with the same name, `optfnt.ttf` or `optfnt.otf` for
`interface\optfnt.fnt`, which is drawn at the window's resolution ([Outline
fonts](../formats/fnt.md#outline-fonts)):

| Font | Used for |
|---|---|
| `optfnt.fnt` | Large text in the menus, the pause menu and the loading screens: titles and labels |
| `smlfnt2.fnt` | Small text in the same places: buttons, lists and OpenReliant's version |
| `itacbig.fnt` | The ITAC's large text, and the titles of the CD player and the simulator pod |
| `itacsml.fnt` | The ITAC's small text |
| `blufont.fnt` | The flight display's text: readouts, clock, windows and objectives |
| `ld_handel.fnt` | The loadout's tooltip |
| `font_01.fnt` | The developers' text on the main menu |

- **Layout.** The game lays out text using the bitmap font's character widths, which don't change.
  Each character of the mod's font is drawn where the bitmap font would put it, centred on the inked
  part of the bitmap glyph, with capitals as tall as the bitmap font's, so a font with other
  proportions still fits each screen.
- **Characters.** The game's text uses Windows code page 1252. Characters the font doesn't have are
  drawn from the bitmap font.
- **Colour.** The flight display's font and the loadout tooltip's font are drawn through palettes. A
  mod's font for them is drawn in the colour of the bitmap font's letters, and glyphs the bitmap
  font draws in other colours, such as symbols, keep their bitmaps.
- **Weight and outline.** A mod's font is drawn at its normal weight. Each character gets a black
  outline one bitmap pixel wide, like the text in the original.
- **Built in.** OpenReliant draws all text except the developers' text with Newtown, a public domain
  font in the style of Handel Gothic, the original's typeface, with strokes as heavy as the bitmap
  font's. A mod's font takes priority over Newtown, and a `.fnt` file in a mod over both.
- **Licence.** The font is distributed with the mod, so its licence must allow that.

A script can also write text in a mod's font, over any of the game's fonts
([Pictures, shapes and fonts](scripting.md#pictures-shapes-and-fonts)).

The loadout's panels, which draw their text into their own pictures, and the flight display's small
fonts, used for target ranges and the radio menu, still use their bitmaps
([#520](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/520)).

**Improvement:** the original draws text with its bitmap fonts at 640x480.

## Faces and voices

The radio's window shows the face of whoever speaks, as a face film, while their line plays. A mod
can replace the game's faces and lines, and give its own pilots faces and voices
([Pilots](#pilots)). A script can also change which line is said, or drop it
([Changing what the radio says](scripting.md#changing-what-the-radio-says)).

### Faces

A face film (`.fm8`, [Face films](../formats/fm8.md)) is a loop of frames, played at 15 frames a
second. Each pilot has a film for talking, one for laughing and one for dying. The game keeps them
in `pilots\pilots.hog`, and `sltool hog ls pilots/pilots.hog` lists their names.

The game's films are 120 by 100 pixels. A mod's film can be sharper, at any size in whole blocks of
4 by 4 pixels: the radio's window draws every film in the same place at the same size, so a film of
480 by 400 shows four times the detail. **Improvement:** the original draws a film at its own size.

A film with the name of one of the game's replaces it. The game plays the 45th's films under the
squadron's name: the 45th Volunteers' through mission 13, and the 45th Tigers' from mission 14,
or as a mission's `flying_tigers` says ([Face films](../formats/fm8.md#playing), [Each mission of
the campaign](scripting.md#each-mission-of-the-campaign)). So replace both, such as `45Volntrs_Moose.fm8` and
`45Tigers_Moose.fm8`. [`examples/mods/trent`](../../examples/mods/trent) gives Moose a new face this
way, and renames him from a load script ([The records](scripting.md#the-records)).

`sltool fm8 encode <frames-dir> <film.fm8>` makes a film of the PNG files in a folder, all the same
size, in the order of their names. A pixel less than half opaque becomes the colour the radio's
window draws see-through. The film keeps every colour where the frames have 256 or fewer,
and picks 256 for them otherwise, the see-through colour kept as it is.
`sltool fm8 extract <film> <out-dir>` saves a film's frames as PNG files, to start from.

### Lines

The game keeps its lines in `ms_speech\msspeech.hog`, under names without an extension, such as
`ABRT_001`. A mod's line replaces the game's line with the same name. `sltool speech extract
ms_speech/msspeech.hog lines` saves every line as a WAV file, to find the one to replace.

A mod's line is best a recording, a WAV or MP3 file named after the line: `abrt_001.wav` or
`abrt_001.mp3` replaces `ABRT_001`. It plays as recorded, at its own rate, mono or stereo, with
the same effects as the game's lines: the radio's sound for a radio line, and a briefing's last word
at the narration's loudness. WAV files can hold 16-bit or 8-bit PCM or IMA ADPCM, which audio
editors write by default. MP3 is about a fifth the size of WAV: 64 kbit/s suits speech. Enriquez's scenes in the
induction and the news reports take recordings too, named after the scene without `.box`, such as
`0015.mp3` for `0015.box`.

A line can also be a speech file in the game's own codec ([Speech files](../formats/speech.md)),
named `abrt_001.ut` or `abrt_001`, which works in older versions of OpenReliant too. Where a mod has
both, the recording is used, and where it has both speech files, `abrt_001`. The codec suits short
radio lines like the game's own, but distorts long, clean speech, such as a spoken briefing.
`sltool speech encode <line.wav> <line.ut>` makes one from a WAV file, which it mixes to mono at
22,050 Hz, the rate the radio plays at:

```bash
sltool speech encode taunt.wav trptnt_001.ut
```

**Improvement:** the original plays lines in its own codec alone.

### A pilot's voice

A ship's pilot says some lines in its own voice: the voice's prefix followed by the line, such as
`bantnt_001` for Bandit's first taunt. The game's voices are `ban`, `dic`, `fre`, `vip`, `enq`,
`sil`, `tak`, `jor`, `vix`, `cut`, `cla`, `ski`, `jui`, `fac`, `haw`, `arr`, `ner`, `rhi`, `sta`,
`fla`, `wor` and `ego` for the pilots on the player's side, and `rus`, `chn` and `arb` for the
enemy's ([Remarks](../engine/radio.md#remarks)).

| Lines | When the pilot says one |
|---|---|
| `tnt_001` to `tnt_013` | An enemy pilot taunts the player after hitting the player's ship |
| `dth_001` to `dth_006` | The pilot dies |
| `ejt_001` | A wingman ejects |
| `res_001` to `res_003` | After a wingman ejects, the wing's last pilot calls in the rescue |
| `_amt_001` to `_amt_008` | A wingman answers ATTACK MY TARGET |
| `_bkoff_001` to `_bkoff_009` | A wingman answers BACK OFF |
| `_hlpme_001` to `_hlpme_008` | A wingman answers HELP ME |

So the voice `trp` has lines such as `trptnt_001` and `trp_amt_001`. A pilot based on Bandit,
Diceman, Viper, Enriquez or Hawkeye answers the wingmen's commands from a fuller set of lines
([The wingmen's commands](../engine/radio.md#the-wingmens-commands)). A line the voice doesn't have
is left out, and the log says so.

## New ships, guns, missiles and pilots

A mod can add ship types, guns, missiles and pilots. Each one is based on one of the game's (a
ship type can also have no base, see [Ship types without a base](#ship-types-without-a-base)):

- It starts with a copy of its base's stats, which a load script can change
  ([The records](scripting.md#the-records)).
- It behaves like its base wherever the game treats that base specially. A ship type based on the
  Phoenix carries the Nova Cannon, a gun based on the Nova Cannon charges up and strikes with its
  own damage, and a missile based on the Havoc sets off a shockwave.

The manifest lists each kind in a section of its own, and describes each entry in a section named
after it:

```ini
[Guns]
banana_gun=

[Gun banana_gun]
Base=pulse_cannon
Name=Banana Gun
```

What all four have in common:

- `Base` is the game's record the new one is based on, by OpenReliant's name for it, such as
  `predator` or `pulse_cannon`, or by its number. Guns, missiles and pilots need one.
- `Name` is what the game calls it, such as on the flight display. Without it, it takes its base's
  name.
- When it starts, OpenReliant numbers what the mods add after the game's records, mod by mod in
  load order, so the numbers depend on which mods are on. Scripts therefore use names: the mod's
  folder name or its archive's name without `.hog`, a colon, and the name in the manifest, such as
  `bananas:banana_gun` for the gun `banana_gun` of the mod in the folder `bananas` or in
  `bananas.hog`.
- The number after a name in the list is the number the mod's own files, such as its missions and
  models, use for it. When OpenReliant loads one of the mod's files, it replaces that number with the
  one it gave, so the files stay in the game's formats. Leave the number empty when the mod's files
  don't use it. Files from other mods or from the game can't use what the mod adds.
- An entry with a mistake, such as a base that isn't one of the game's, is left out, and the log says
  why.

| Kind | List section | Its own section | First number | Most the mods add | Numbered in the mod's |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship types | `[ShipTypes]` | `[ShipType name]` | 256 | 732 | missions' ships |
| Guns | `[Guns]` | `[Gun name]` | 16 | 240 | models' gun muzzles |
| Missiles | `[Missiles]` | `[Missile name]` | 11 | 245 | models' missile hardpoints, for every loadout tier |
| Pilots | `[Pilots]` | `[Pilot name]` | 194 | 61 | missions' ships' pilots |

[`examples/mods/interceptor`](../../examples/mods/interceptor) adds a faster Predator under a name
of its own, [`examples/mods/bananas`](../../examples/mods/bananas) a gun, a missile, a pilot and a
ship that carries them, and [`examples/mods/teapot`](../../examples/mods/teapot) a ship with a model
of its own, made from an OBJ file ([Models from OBJ](#models-from-obj)).

**Improvement:** the original's ship types, guns, missiles and pilots are its own.

### Ship types

```ini
[ShipTypes]
teapot=300

[ShipType teapot]
Base=predator
Model=teapot.shp
Schematic=teapotscem.spr
Name=Teapot
Guns=banana_gun
Missiles=banana
Cockpit=temg_frm.shp
WireFrame=teapotwire
WingIcon=teapoticon
EngineSound=kettle.wav
```

- A ship type uses its base's cockpit, engine sound and display pictures, except for the ones it
  gives itself.
- `Model` is the type's model, a `.shp` file in the mod or the game ([`.SHP`
  models](../formats/shp.md)). It can be one of the game's models under the new type's own stats.
- `Schematic` is the sprite set the display shows the ship in, as the player's ship and as a target.
  Without it, the type shows its base's. Where the mod has no file of that name, the type takes the
  base's sprite set as a template, and the mod's pictures named after the schematic draw over its
  shapes ([Shapes](#shapes)): `teapotscem_000.png` is the ship, and `teapotscem_001.png` to
  `teapotscem_004.png` the hit markers of its four quadrants, which otherwise stay the base's.
- `Guns` is the gun every gun of the model fires, and `Missiles` the missile every hardpoint holds,
  whatever the model names: one of the game's by its name, one a mod adds by its qualified name, or
  one this mod adds by its own name.

A ship type based on one of the twelve ships the player can fly, or without a base, is offered on
the loadout screen too, after the game's ships:

- `Tier` is the campaign tier it's first offered at, 0 at the start to 3 after mission 21.
  Without it, it's offered from the start of the campaign.
- Its name and its model are its own, drawn in green (see
  [Textures in the loadout](#textures-in-the-loadout)), and shown as large as its base whatever
  its model's size. The bars on its panel show its own stats, measured against the game's fighters.
- `Class`, `Access` and `Crew` set what the panel says about it. `Class` is one of `light`,
  `light_medium`, `medium`, `heavy`, `advanced_heavy`, `prototype_medium` and `prototype_light`,
  `Access` one of `bronze`, `silver`, `gold` and `platinum`, and `Crew` a number. Without them, the
  panel shows its base's. Its specials and guns are its base's.
- `GunsModel` is the model the guns view shows in place of the ship, a `.shp` file in the mod or the
  game, in the same units as `Model`. Make it as the game's are, such as `predator_gun.shp`: the hull
  in lines, which only the ambient light reaches, and the guns as solid parts. Without it, the guns
  view shows its base's gun model.
- The arc holds twelve ships. When the game's ships leave no room, the mods' ship types that don't
  fit aren't offered, and the log says so.
- A saved game keeps a mod's ship type as its base, so that the original can still load it.
  OpenReliant keeps the mod's own beside the save ([Saved games](../formats/save.md#in-openreliant)),
  and puts it back when the save is loaded with the mod still on.

When the player flies it, it can also give:

- `Cockpit`, the model of the cockpit's frame, a `.shp` file in the mod or the game, such as the
  Tempest's `temg_frm.shp`.
- `WireFrame`, the name of the pictures the gunnery display shows the ship as, in place of its
  base's wire frame: `teapotwire_000.png` is the ship, and `teapotwire_001.png` on the ship with
  its first, second and later group of guns lit, which the display shows over it for a ship of more
  than one group. Each is drawn over the base's wire frame's rectangle, so make them all the same
  size, in the shape of the base's: the Predator's is 92 by 108 of the display's pixels, and a
  picture at two or four times that keeps it sharp. A picture left out keeps the base's shape.
- `WingIcon`, the name of the picture the wing's window shows the ship as, `teapoticon_000.png`,
  drawn over the base's icon's rectangle.
- `EngineSound`, a WAV file, PCM or IMA ADPCM, that loops as the engine's sound, pitched and
  loudened by the throttle as the base's is. Give it whole cycles of each tone, so that its loop
  doesn't click.
- `BlindFire` and `SpectralShields`, `yes` or `no`, whether it carries blind fire and spectral
  shields. Without them, it carries what its base carries. The loadout lists them with its specials.

A mission can launch ships from a mod's ship type, the player's among them. One that keeps its
base's model launches them as its base does, such as from the Reliant's tubes. One with a model of
its own launches them as a hangar bay: each ship waits at the launch point of its gate, a
`launch_point` object of the model ([Models from OBJ](#models-from-obj)), and flies out once its
launch starts.

#### Ship types without a base

A ship type can leave out `Base`. It then behaves like no ship the game treats specially:

- Its stats start as a copy of the Predator's, which a load script can change
  ([The records](scripting.md#the-records)). The loadout shows it at the Predator's size.
- It carries blind fire or spectral shields only if `BlindFire` or `SpectralShields` says so.
- On the loadout's panel, it is `light`, `bronze` and has a crew of 1, unless `Class`, `Access` and
  `Crew` say otherwise.
- The loadout reads its guns and specials from its model: each kind of gun its gun muzzles fire,
  or the gun `Guns` names, up to four kinds; the Nova Cannon if it fires one; the cloaking device
  if the model can cloak; and reverse thrust if an engine glow points forward. Without a
  `GunsModel`, the guns view shows its own model, all in red.
- Its cockpit, engine sound and display pictures are the Predator's unless it gives its own.
- A saved game keeps it as the Predator.

### Guns

```ini
[Guns]
banana_gun=

[Gun banana_gun]
Base=pulse_cannon
Name=Banana Gun
Shot=banana_shot.png
ShotSize=40
Sound=boing.wav
Flash=banana_shot.png
FlashSize=300
```

A gun uses its base's shots, flashes and sounds, except for the ones it gives itself:

- `Shot` is a picture in the mod, which each shot is drawn as: one flare of it, facing the camera,
  fading with the shot's life. It is found as the mods' textures are, by its name without the
  extension, so a PNG, DDS or KTX2 file works. Give it a transparent background.
- `ShotSize` is how far the picture reaches from the shot's middle in each direction. The default
  is 60, the size of the Pulse Cannon's flare.
- `Sound` is a WAV file in the mod, PCM or IMA ADPCM, that each shot makes in place of its base's.
  It is heard as its base's sound is: as far, as loud, and following the shot.
- `Flash` is a picture in the mod, which the muzzle flash is drawn with as each shot leaves the
  gun, in place of its base's flares: across the muzzle and in three blades along the flash, added
  to what's behind it, shrinking away as its base's does. It is found as `Shot` is. Black is
  see-through, so draw it on black. Where flashes light the ship, its light takes the picture's
  colour.
- `FlashSize` is how far the flash reaches forward of the muzzle, its width keeping its base's
  proportions. The default is its base's flash, 600 for the guns based on the fighters' guns.

A gun whose `Sound` is missing from the mod, or isn't a WAV file, is left out, and the log says so.
A model gives each gun muzzle a gun type by number, so a mod's own model fires the mod's guns by the
numbers in `[Guns]`. A ship type can also fire one with `Guns`, whatever its model says.

### Missiles

```ini
[Missiles]
banana=

[Missile banana]
Base=bandit
Name=Banana
Model=banana.shp
Description=A homing banana. It locks on slowly, but nothing outruns it.
Tier=0
```

A missile uses its base's trail, sounds and flight display picture. What `Model` is depends on the
base:

- For a base that hangs on a rail (the Havoc, the Jack Hammer, the Bandit, the Vagabond and the
  Imp), `Model` is the missile that hangs on the hardpoint and launches from it.
- For a base that hangs in a pod (the Screamer, the Raptor, the Solomon and the Hawk), `Model` is
  the missile that flies out of the pod, and `Pod` is the pod that hangs on the hardpoint. Without
  `Pod`, the base's pod is used.

A mod's own model can hold the missile on its hardpoints, and a ship type can carry it with
`Missiles`.

The loadout screen offers it on its missile page too, with the game's missiles:

- `Tier` is the campaign tier it's first offered at, 0 at the start to 3 after mission 21, else
  its base's. A missile based on the torpedo, which the loadout never offers, isn't offered.
- `Description` is the text on its panel. Without it, the panel shows its base's text. The panel's
  figures are its own, measured against the game's missiles, and a ship carries as many of it as of
  its base.
- Its icon on the arc is the model that hangs on the hardpoint: `Model`, or `Pod` for a base that
  hangs in a pod, else its base's loadout model. Its red copy is made from its picture (see
  [Textures in the loadout](#textures-in-the-loadout)).
- The arc has twelve places, and the game's missiles take five to ten of them by the tier. The
  mods' missiles take the free places in the order the mods load; the log says when some don't
  fit.
- A saved game keeps a mod's missile on a rack as its base, so that the original can still load it.
  OpenReliant keeps the mod's own beside the save, and puts it back when the save is loaded with
  the mod still on.

### Pilots

```ini
[Pilots]
trooper=

[Pilot trooper]
Base=21
Name=Trooper
Voice=rus
```

A pilot uses its base's face and voice on the radio, except for the ones it gives itself. `Base` is
a pilot's number in `pilotstats.bin`. A mission gives its ships' pilots by number, so a mod's own
missions use the mod's pilots by the numbers in `[Pilots]`. A script can set the pilot of any ship
([Objects](scripting.md#objects)), as the `bananas` example does.

- `Talking`, `Laughing` and `Dying` name the face films the radio's window plays as the pilot speaks,
  laughs and dies: one of the game's, such as `45volntrs_plt` from `pilots.hog`, or a `.fm8` file in
  the mod, with or without its extension ([Faces](#faces)). A fourth film, the 45th's pilot, is the
  same for every pilot and can't be changed.
- `Voice` is the prefix of the names of the pilot's lines ([A pilot's voice](#a-pilots-voice)). The
  pilot uses it on either side, in place of its base's two voices. It can be one of the game's,
  such as `ban` for Bandit's or `rus` for the Coalition's, or a new one, whose lines the mod
  gives.

## Models

A model is a `.shp` file ([`.SHP` models](../formats/shp.md)). `sltool` builds one for a mod from an
OBJ or a glTF file, and exports the game's models as glTF to start from.

### Models from OBJ

`sltool shp from-obj` builds a model for a mod from a Wavefront OBJ file, which Blender and most
modelling tools export, with nothing of the game's in it:

```bash
sltool shp from-obj teapot.obj teapot.shp --two-sided
```

Each object in the file becomes a part of the model according to its name, written in any case. A
suffix such as `.001`, which modelling tools add to copies, is ignored:

| Object | What it becomes |
|---|---|
| `cockpit` | The cockpit, a part of its own, which leaves the ship as the pilot's pod when the pilot ejects |
| `gun_muzzle:<gun type>` | Where a gun fires from, a gun of that type, by its number in `gunstats.bin` (1, the Laser Cannon, without one) |
| `missile:<missile>` | A missile hardpoint, holding that missile type for every loadout tier (0 without one) |
| `engine_glow:<glow>` | An engine's glow, burning backward from the middle of its box: the box's width and height are the plume's, half its length how far the plume reaches at full throttle. The number picks one of the game's seven glows; the player's ships use 1 |
| `light:<colour>` | A light: a sprite as large as its box, which lights nothing round it |
| `eject_point` | Where the pilot's pod is thrown up from, on the cockpit where there is one |
| `launch_point`, `dock_point` | Where a ship launches from or docks |
| `jump_trail` | Where one of the trails streams from when the ship jumps |
| `jump_light` | Where one of the lights flashes along the hull when the ship jumps |
| anything else | The body |

An attachment sits at the middle of its object's corners, and is as large as their bounding box, so
a small box or a single triangle is enough to mark one. In the teapot's OBJ file, each gun muzzle,
engine glow and missile hardpoint is one triangle:

```text
o Teapot
usemtl teapot
f 1/1/1 2/2/2 7/7/7
...
o cockpit
usemtl teapot
f 501/501/501 507/507/507 506/506/506
...
o gun_muzzle:1
f 801 802 803
o engine_glow:0
f 807 808 809
o missile:0
f 813 814 815
o eject_point
f 825 826 827
```

- **Textures.** Each face of the body and the cockpit takes the texture its `usemtl` names, by the
  texture's name without its extension, such as `teapot` for `teapot.png` in the mod. A face without
  a `usemtl` is drawn untextured. The `.mtl` file isn't read.
- **Normals.** A vertex uses the normal the file gives it. Without one, it gets the average of the
  normals of the faces around it.
- **Options.** `--two-sided` draws every face from behind as well, for a model with open edges.
  `--cloak` adds the meshes a ship needs to cloak. `--density` sets how heavy each part is for its
  size: the default, 0.1, makes a ship about as heavy as the Predator at the Predator's size.
- **Axes.** The file is read as Blender exports it, with Y up and the nose toward +Z. `sltool shp
  obj` exports the game's models the same way, so a game model exported and built again comes back
  in the same place.
- **Size.** A part holds at most 65,535 vertices and 65,535 triangles, the format's limit, and
  `sltool` stops with an error past it. The game's fighters have a few hundred triangles; OpenReliant
  draws tens of thousands, but each one costs time in every frame, shadows included.
- **What is generated.** Each part gets one level of detail, a collision tree of boxes around its
  faces, and a mass as though it filled its bounding box. A model without `jump_trail` objects gets
  a jump trail at each engine glow, so that each engine streams one when the ship jumps.

[`examples/mods/teapot`](../../examples/mods/teapot) builds its ship this way, and
[`examples/mods/bananas`](../../examples/mods/bananas) its missile.

### Models from glTF

`sltool shp from-gltf` builds a model for a mod from a glTF 2.0 file, the format Blender and most
modelling tools export and most model sites offer. It reads a `.gltf` file with its buffers in files
beside it or inside it, or a binary `.glb` file:

```bash
sltool shp from-gltf viper.gltf mods/viper/viper.shp --scale 2
```

The model is built as from an OBJ file ([Models from OBJ](#models-from-obj)), with the same names
and options:

- **Nodes.** Each node with a mesh becomes an object of its name, and each node without a mesh or
  children, such as Blender's empty, marks an attachment or a jump point by its name, such as
  `gun_muzzle:1`. A marker is a cube two units across, scaled, turned and moved as its node is, so
  scale an engine glow's marker along its length to give its plume that length. Every node's
  transform is applied, and `--scale` scales the whole model.
- **Materials.** Each material becomes a texture named after the model and its number, such as
  `viper_0.png` for `viper.shp`, written next to the model with its maps ([Material
  maps](#material-maps)): the colour, which is the colour texture multiplied by the colour if there
  is one; the roughness and metalness, from the textures and values; the normal map; and the
  emissive map if the material glows, `KHR_materials_emissive_strength` included. Every map has the
  size of the colour texture.
  Textures must be PNG files. A texture that isn't a PNG file, or whose file is missing or can't be
  read, is skipped with a warning.
- **What isn't read.** Animations, skins, morph targets, cameras, lights, sparse accessors, a second
  set of texture coordinates, and the extensions beyond the emissive strength. A file that requires
  an extension other than `KHR_materials_emissive_strength`, `KHR_materials_specular` or
  `KHR_texture_transform`, which it can be drawn without, isn't read.

### The game's models as glTF

To start from one of the game's models, `sltool shp gltf` writes it as glTF, its attachments as
empty nodes named as `from-gltf` reads them, and with `--textures` its pictures beside it:

```bash
sltool shp gltf USLF_Prd.SHP predator.gltf --textures tcachehw.dat palette.tga
```

Each part is a node under the part it hangs from, with its first level of detail (`--lod` picks
another). Without `--textures`, the materials name their pictures, but the pictures aren't written.
When you build the model again with `from-gltf`, every part except one named `cockpit` joins the
body, the textures are renamed after the new model, and missing pictures are skipped. Share only
your own work in a mod, never the game's models or pictures.

## Missions

A mission is a `.DTE` file ([`.DTE` missions](../formats/dte.md)) named after its number, such as
`mission5.dte`. The game keeps its missions in `missions\` and `resource.hog`. A mod's
`mission5.dte` replaces mission 5, and a mission with a number of its own, such as `mission90.dte`,
adds one, which a game mode can fly ([Game modes](scripting.md#game-modes)) and `--mission 90`
starts. A mission numbered from 1 to 28 can also join the game's campaign, such as the missions 12,
13, 17 and 22 that the campaign doesn't fly ([The campaign's
missions](scripting.md#the-campaigns-missions)). A load script gives it what the campaign gives its
missions: the briefing, the carrier, the objectives, the date, the awards, Enriquez's report and
debriefing, the ITAC's news, the landing and the wing's pilots ([Each mission of the
campaign](scripting.md#each-mission-of-the-campaign)).

A mod that puts mission 12 back has `mission12.dte`, a recording of its spoken briefing,
`brief12.mp3`, and a load script:

```ini
[Mod]
Name=Mission 12 Restored
Version=1.0

[Scripts]
Load=campaign.luau
```

```lua
-- campaign.luau
local records = require("openreliant.records")

-- Fly mission 12 between missions 11 and 14.
local campaign = records.campaign
table.insert(campaign, 12)
table.sort(campaign)
records.campaign = campaign

-- Enriquez speaks the briefing over another mission's movie, and debriefs it.
local mission = records.missions[12]
mission.hologram = "new_m05.bik"
mission.speech = "brief12.ut"
mission.objectives = { "Protect the Reliant", "Destroy the Black Guard" }
local debriefing = mission.debriefing
debriefing.success = { "Good work out there. The Reliant is safe, for now." }
mission.debriefing = debriefing
```

- OpenReliant reads a mission as the original does, and has no mission format of its own. A mission
  made for the original works in OpenReliant, and one made for OpenReliant works in the original
  unless it uses what a mod adds.
- A mod's mission can use the ship types, guns, missiles and pilots the mod adds, by the numbers in
  its manifest ([New ships, guns, missiles and pilots](#new-ships-guns-missiles-and-pilots)).
- A script can run with a mission: the manifest lists it under `[Missions]`
  ([Kinds of scripts](scripting.md#kinds-of-scripts)).
- `sltool dte` lists a mission's ships, triggers and script parts, and disassembles its script
  ([Tools](#tools)).
- OpenReliant has no mission editor yet ([#360](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/360),
  [#608](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/608)).
  [StarLancerEditor](https://src.ug.gg/mini/starlancereditor), a community project, turns missions
  into YAML files and back.

### Checking a mission

A mission a mod adds or replaces can be started straight from the command line, and checked at any
moment of it without flying up to that moment ([Configuration](configuration.md#the-mission)):

```bash
openreliant --mission 2 --skip-launch --part "antanov in" --screenshot antanov.png --screenshot-ticks 1000
openreliant --mission 2 --skip-launch --watch reliant --screenshot reliant.png --screenshot-ticks 300
```

- `--mission <number>` starts the mission, from a mod or the game.
- `--skip-launch` plays the player's launch through without showing it.
- `--part <name>` runs a part of the mission's script once the launch is over, as a trigger would.
  `sltool dte parts` lists the parts. A part starts from the mission's opening state, so one that
  counts on ships or flags from an earlier part may find them missing.
- `--watch <ship>` points the camera at one of the mission's ships, and `--watch-from` says from
  where. `sltool dte ships` lists the ships. A ship's whole name picks it, though other ships'
  names hold it too, such as `RELIANT` beside `RELIANT NANNY`. A cutscene in the mission's script
  takes the camera from it.
- `--screenshot` saves a picture after `--screenshot-ticks` game ticks and quits.

`openreliant missions` lists and checks the missions, the mods' included, and shows `mod` in the
file column for a mod's mission. It also takes `--no-mods`.

## Scripts

Mods can include scripts written in [Luau](https://luau.org), a version of Lua, which OpenReliant
runs while you play. [Scripting](scripting.md) explains them step by step, starting from a first
script, and the [scripting reference](reference.md) lists everything they can use. In short:

- **Load scripts** run once at startup and change the game's records: the stats of ships, guns,
  missiles and pilots, and the game's text.
- **Global scripts** run for the whole game, and **mission scripts** while their mission runs. They
  react to what happens in the game, and change it, through hooks on the game's functions and
  events.
- **Object scripts** run on each ship of a class or a type, such as every fighter, while it's in
  the mission, **missile scripts** on each missile in flight, and **turret scripts** on each
  turret.
- **Player and menu scripts** draw over the flight display and the menus, and react to the keys.
  Menu scripts can also replace the front end's screens, and add game modes and campaigns to the
  main menu's GAME MODES ([Menus, game modes and campaigns](scripting.md#menus-game-modes-and-campaigns)).

A mod lists its scripts in its manifest:

```ini
[Scripts]
Load=balance.luau
Global=rules.luau

[Missions]
mission2.dte=escort.luau
```

Scripts are ordinary files of the mod: a folder mod keeps them next to `mod.ini`, and `sltool hog
pack` packs them into the archive. The shaders of a mod's post effects and functions, files
ending in `.frag` or `.glsl`, are kept the same way ([Post effects](scripting.md#post-effects)).
Neither scripts nor shaders replace game files, but a mod's `device.glsl`, `bloom.glsl` or
`shadow.glsl` can replace OpenReliant's own shader
([Replacing OpenReliant's shaders](scripting.md#replacing-openreliants-shaders)).
[`examples/mods`](../../examples/mods) holds example mods for mod makers, which show how the
scripting works and aren't supported mods.

**Improvement:** the original has no scripting apart from its mission scripts.

## Tools

`sltool` comes with `openreliant` in each release
([Builds and releases](../port/platform.md#builds-and-releases)). The commands a mod maker uses
most:

| To | Run |
|---|---|
| List or extract an archive's files | `sltool hog ls <archive>`, `sltool hog extract <archive> <out-dir>` |
| Pack a folder mod into an archive | `sltool hog pack <folder> <archive> --checksum` |
| Save the game's textures as PNG files | `sltool tcache extract tcachehw.dat palette.tga <out-dir> [name...]` |
| Save a sprite set's shapes as PNG files | `sltool spr extract <sprite> <out-dir>` |
| Export one of the game's models | `sltool shp gltf <model> <out.gltf>`, `sltool shp obj <model> <out.obj>` |
| Build a model | `sltool shp from-obj <in.obj> <out.shp>`, `sltool shp from-gltf <in.gltf> <out.shp>` |
| Save a face film's frames, or make a film | `sltool fm8 extract <film> <out-dir>`, `sltool fm8 encode <frames-dir> <film>` |
| Save lines as WAV files, or make a line | `sltool speech extract <archive> <out-dir>`, `sltool speech encode <in.wav> <out.ut>` |
| Save a sound bank's sounds as WAV files | `sltool fat extract <bank> <out-dir>` |
| List a mission's ships, triggers and script parts | `sltool dte ships <mission>`, `sltool dte triggers <mission>`, `sltool dte parts <mission>` |
| List a stats table | `sltool stats list <stats.bin>` |

`sltool help` lists every command, and the [README](../../README.md#reverse-engineering--analysis-tools)
links each one to its format's page. `openreliant` has three commands for mod makers too:
`openreliant missions` checks missions ([Checking a mission](#checking-a-mission)),
`openreliant hooks` lists the hooks scripts can use ([Hooks](scripting.md#hooks)), and
`openreliant debug` steps through a mission's script as the game plays it
([Debugging mission scripts](debugging.md)).

## Sharing a mod

A folder mod is handy while you work on it. To share it, pack it into one archive, which players
put in their `mods` folder:

```bash
sltool hog pack mods/coyote coyote.hog --checksum
```

The archive holds every file of the folder, the manifest, the thumbnail, the scripts and the shaders
included, and works just as the folder did. `--checksum` writes `coyote.hog.sha256` beside it
([Checksums](#checksums)).

- Give the manifest a `Name`, a `Version`, a `Description` and a `Url`, so that players know what
  the mod is and where to find its updates, and `OpenReliant` for the version it needs
  ([The manifest](#the-manifest)).
- Share only work you may share: your own, or work whose licence lets you share it. Fonts, models,
  pictures and sounds from elsewhere each have a licence of their own.
- [OpenReliant's mods page](https://openreliant.github.io/openreliant-mods/) lists mods made for
  OpenReliant, and the mods screen's GET MODS installs them from it
  ([Getting mods from the catalogue](#getting-mods-from-the-catalogue)).

### The thumbnail

A mod can include a picture of itself, `mod.png`, which the mods screen shows above the mod's
details. It fits in a box 175 by 70 of the screen's 640x480 points, so a wide picture such as
700x280 fills it best. Like the manifest, it doesn't replace any game file.

### Checksums

An archive can have a checksum file next to it: the archive's name plus `.sha256`, in the format
`sha256sum` writes (the archive's SHA-256 hash in hexadecimal, two spaces, and the archive's name).
When the mod loads, OpenReliant checks the archive against it, and skips the mod if they don't
match, since the archive is then damaged or isn't the one the checksum was made for. The mods screen
lists it in red. `sltool hog
pack <folder> <archive> --checksum` writes a checksum file next to the archive it makes, and
`sha256sum -c music.hog.sha256` checks one by hand. Folder mods don't have checksums.

## Log messages

OpenReliant writes its log to the terminal it runs in, and to `openreliant.log` in the game folder
([The log file](installation.md#the-log-file)). Attach it to a
[mod or scripting problem](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/new?template=mod_problem.yml)
when you report one. As it
starts, it lists each mod it loads, in order, by its manifest's name if it has one, and then what
each of the mod's files does: which game file, texture, shape, picture, font or line it replaces,
which earlier mod's file it replaces, or which file it adds. A mod that the mods screen has turned
off is listed as off, and none of it is used. When a font is loaded, the log says which outline
font draws it.

```text
info(mods): music.hog matches music.hog.sha256
info(mods): mod 1 of 2: Coyote HD 1.0, by Someone (coyote)
info(mods): coyote replaces USA_Coyote.SHP
info(mods): mod 2 of 2: music.hog
info(mods): music.hog replaces New_Pensive.wav
info(mods): music.hog adds msc_theme.wav
info(mods): the mod old-ships is off
info(fonts): optfnt.fnt uses Newtown, with strokes 0.002 em wider
info(scripts): balance: ran balance.luau
info(scripts): balance: the Laser Cannon hits shields for 10 and hulls for 10
```

A script's messages and errors follow its mod's name, as above;
[Scripting](scripting.md#when-something-goes-wrong) explains the common ones.

### When something goes wrong

| In the log | What to check |
|---|---|
| A file `adds` where it should replace one of the game's | Its name: the game file's name, without folders, in any case. Textures, pictures, shapes, lines and faces are named as their sections say. If the log also says `can't list the game's ...`, the name may be right |
| `can't list the game's archive <name>, so the log may say a mod adds a file it replaces` | The game's archive is damaged. The mod still works if its files are named right |
| `skipping <name>: <error>` | A link in `mods` or in a mod whose target is missing, or an entry that can't be read: fix or remove it |
| `skipping <name>: a mod must be a .hog archive or a folder` | Only folders and `.hog` archives go directly in `mods` |
| `skipping <mod>/<file>: a mod's files must be directly in its folder` | Move the file out of its subfolder |
| `skipping <mod>/<file>: file names must be printable ASCII, like archive member names` | Rename the file |
| `skipping the mod <mod>: it needs OpenReliant <version>, and this is <version>` | Update OpenReliant, or check the mod's `OpenReliant=` ([The manifest](#the-manifest)) |
| `skipping the mod <mod>: it needs the mod <name>, which doesn't load before it` | Add that mod, turn it on, or move it above this one on the mods screen ([The manifest](#the-manifest)) |
| `skipping the mod <archive>: checking <file> failed: ...` | The archive doesn't match its checksum: download it again, or pack it again with `--checksum` ([Checksums](#checksums)) |
| `<mod>: mod.ini: the <kind> '<name>' ...` | The entry the message names, and what it says is wrong ([New ships, guns, missiles and pilots](#new-ships-guns-missiles-and-pilots)) |
| `skipping the picture that replaces <name>: it's <size>, and the original is <size>` | That picture must keep the original's size ([Pictures](#pictures)) |
| `the <map> of <texture> is left out: it is <size> and its picture <size>` | A map must be the same size as its texture ([Material maps](#material-maps)) |
| `the <map> of <texture> is left out: it has <n> mipmap levels and its picture <n>` | Save the DDS or KTX2 map with all its mipmaps, as many as the picture has ([Compression](#compression)) |
| `<file> is left out: it is compressed in <format>, which the device doesn't take` | The GPU doesn't take that format; use a PNG file instead ([Compression](#compression)) |
| `the line <name> is not in ms_speech/msspeech.hog` | The line's name ([Lines](#lines)) |
| `the radio's film <name> is left out: ...` | The film's name ([Faces](#faces)) |
| `the dead channel's film pilots\static.fm8 is left out too: ...` | The game's `pilots.hog` is missing or damaged |
| `the mod's music <path> may loop back to the wrong moment, since the game's piece can't be read: ...` | Keep the game's piece in the game folder ([Music](#music)) |
