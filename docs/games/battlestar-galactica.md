# Battlestar Galactica

Battlestar Galactica (2003) is an Xbox and PlayStation 2 game by Warthog, who developed
StarLancer. Its game logic is StarLancer's, carried forward: its missions keep StarLancer's records
and script bytecode, its command catalogue and trigger conditions extend StarLancer's, and its
stats, combat maneuvers and comms films come from StarLancer's. Its archives, models and executable
are new. [#1017](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1017) tracks what it shares
with StarLancer.

```bash
sltool cd extract <image> <dir>                 # the disc's files
sltool bsg sections <mission.dte>               # a mission's directory
sltool bsg parts <mission.dte>                  # its script's routines
sltool bsg triggers <mission.dte>               # its triggers
sltool bsg script <mission.dte> <default.xbe>   # its script, with the commands' names

```

The code is in [`src/formats/games/bsg/`](../../src/formats/games/bsg), and the Xbox's own formats
are in [`src/formats/xbox/`](../../src/formats/xbox). This page describes the European Xbox
disc.

## The disc

The disc holds an Xbox volume ([Xbox formats](../formats/xbox.md#discs)):

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `default.xbe` | The executable. |
| `Missions\*.dte` | The missions ([Missions](#missions)). |
| `Missions\<language>\*.loc` | The missions' text in each language: the subtitles, one line each. |
| `ship.txt`, `bullet.txt`, `missile.txt`, `pilot.txt` | The stats ([Stats](#stats)). |
| `evade.txt` | The combat maneuvers' weights ([Combat maneuvers](#combat-maneuvers)). |
| `vqmdata.txt`, `movies.txt` | Lists of the comms films ([Comms films](#comms-films)). |
| `comms\video.idx`, `comms\videodata.dat` | The comms films. |
| `comms\audio.idx`, `comms\audiodata.dat` | The comms' sound, going by the names. **Unknown:** its format. |
| `bigwad.hxb`, `gui.hxb`, `sfx.hxb`, `extra.hxb`, `wads\*.hxb` | The archives ([Archives](#archives)). |
| `Movies\` | The movies, as Xbox XMV files. |
| `fonts\` | Fonts, as TGA pictures with `.tnf` files. |

The executable ([Xbox formats](../formats/xbox.md#executables)) is stripped: it holds no source
paths or assertions, but holds the command catalogue with the developers' descriptions, the trigger
conditions' names, and `$Revision: N $` strings of their version control. It draws with the Xbox's
Direct3D.

## Missions

A mission keeps StarLancer's `.DTE` extension and its records, behind a new directory:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `0xDEADDEAD` |
| 4 | 120 | 15 entries of 8 bytes |
| `0x7C` | 4 | Zero |

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | The section's offset in the file |
| 4 | 2 | Its count of records |
| 6 | 1 | Zero |
| 7 | 1 | The size of a record |

StarLancer's directory has 27 fixed entries of a count, a zero byte, flags and an offset
([`.DTE` missions](../formats/dte.md#directory)). In every mission, the first section starts at
`0x80`, a section fills its count times its record size, and 16 bytes of `0xCD`, the debug fill of
Microsoft's C runtime, follow each section.

| Entry | Record size | Contents | StarLancer's section |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x50` | The ships: StarLancer's `0x4C`-byte records and 4 bytes more. Every field up to `formation_point` at `0x34` matches StarLancer's. **Unverified:** the rest. | `ships` (3) |
| 1 | `0x14` | The flight groups: each starts with a flight group's object ID. | `flight_groups` (4) |
| 2 | `0x10` | The squads: each starts with a squad's object ID, in 16 bytes where StarLancer's take 12. | `squads` (12) |
| 3 | `0x0C` | The squad members: an object ID at `+0` and a squad's index at `+4`. | `squad_members` (13) |
| 4 | 8 | The objects. | `objects` (7) |
| 5 | 4 | A record for each object. **Unknown:** what it holds. | |
| 6 | `0x44` | The curves, in StarLancer's layout. | `curves` (16) |
| 7 | `0x0C` | **Unverified:** the globals. No script uses a global past their count. | `globals` (2) |
| 8 | `0x1C` | The parts. | `parts` (8) |
| 9 | `0x30` | The triggers. | `triggers` (5) |
| 10 | 2 | The script, counted in halfwords. | `script` (6) |
| 11 | 2 | The command flags, one for each of the 161 commands. | `command_flags` (24) |
| 12 | 2 | Empty in every mission. **Unknown.** | |
| 13 | 4 | **Unknown:** floats, such as 1.0. | |
| 14 | | Unused in every mission. | |

The missions carry no string pool. The ships, flight groups and parts keep their names' offsets,
but the names aren't in the file. **Unknown:** where they went. The executable names `BIGDTE.HXB`
and `MISSION1_1.DTE`, which the disc doesn't hold.

The script has StarLancer's bytecode ([Script VM](../engine/script-vm.md)), with the subtitles
and the comms films' names inline, as `push_string` runs. Given a directory in StarLancer's layout
that points at these sections, StarLancer's mission reader reads the missions' parts, triggers and
routines. One trigger, for example, plays the comms film `AD_01_06.wmv` with its line, waits three
seconds and ends the mission. `sltool bsg` reads them that way, and names the commands from the
catalogue in the game's executable. **Unknown:** two routines reach a `0x55` followed by a byte
that isn't a StarLancer opcode, so the game may have changed `0x55` or added an instruction.

## Commands

The executable holds the Executor's command catalogue at the address `0x0015D968`, in
StarLancer's layout:
`0x74`-byte entries of the implementation, the parameter count, the name, eight parameters of
kinds, a second word and a label, then the description and a flag
([Script VM](../engine/script-vm.md)). It has 161 commands where StarLancer has 95.

68 of StarLancer's commands keep their numbers, such as `CreateTimer` (`0x01`), `SetAI`
(`0x0B`), `StartDirectorCam` (`0x10`), `ShipFollowCurve` (`0x12`), `Dock` (`0x26`), `Fly` (`0x28`)
and `TerminateMission` (`0x4D`). Some take other arguments: `TerminateMission` takes whether the
mission succeeded, and `StartShipAnimation` whether the animation plays once, looped or backward.
These numbers hold other commands:

| Number | StarLancer's | Battlestar Galactica's |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0D` | `SetPatrolRoute` | `DestroyAllTimers` |
| `0x0E` | `SetPilot` | `StartDeathCam` |
| `0x15` | `DisplaySubTitle` | `HugeExplosion` |
| `0x1D` | `PositionRelative` | `FullStop` |
| `0x1F` | `StartMissileCam` | `FlashTurretGraphic` |
| `0x20` | `StartChaseCam` | `SetShipNameID` |
| `0x27` | `DisableTaunts` | `BreakDCam` |
| `0x2B` | `DisableLights` | `EnableFXLightning` |
| `0x2C` | `SetEnvironmentFX` | `DebugBreak` |
| `0x2D` | `MultiPlayerSync` | `FireNeutronCannon` |
| `0x32` | `ResetAfterBurners` | `SetRadarVisibility` |
| `0x35` | `DisableEject` | `ReduceHealth` |
| `0x36` | `SetHostile` | `SetMatchTarget` |
| `0x37` | `ResetToSpawnPositions` | `RandomWithExclude` |
| `0x38` | `UpdateEnvironmentFXState` | `SetAmbientLighting` |
| `0x3C` | `SetEnvironmentFXNebula` | `SetEnvironmentFXSkybox` |
| `0x3D` | `StartShipAnimationReverse` | `SetSpaceRocks` |
| `0x3F` | `PlayFostersLastStand` | `SetHealth` |
| `0x43` | `SetObjective` | `SetObjectiveState` |
| `0x44` | `SetRescueProbabilities` | `SetNebulaGas` |
| `0x45` | `IsShipThisPlayer` | `EjectSubobjectUltra` |
| `0x51` | `KillAllScriptExecutionExecptMe` | `KillAllScriptExecutionExceptMe`, the same command with its name corrected |
| `0x53` | `Scanner` | `DisableEngineTrails` |
| `0x56` | `MultiplayerScriptSync` | `TumbleUnderGravity` |
| `0x59` | `ReplenishWeapons` | `DisableAllTriggers` |
| `0x5A` | `WillsBlag` | `CreateAsteroidField` |
| `0x5E` | `DarrensNaughtyBlag` | `SetFlameTrail` |

`DebugBreak` is described as "Causes a debug breakpoint to be hit". The executable holds neither of
the strings of StarLancer's editor link ("unidentified comms request", `FileMappingObject`).
**Unverified:** whether it keeps a link to its editor of another kind
([The editor link](../engine/editor-link.md#clients)).

The commands after StarLancer's run from `0x5F` to `0xA0`, in this order: `SetPlayerBombs`,
`IgnoreForCollision`, the tutorial's waits from `WaitForDecreaseVelocity` to `WaitForStrafeRight`
(`0x61` to `0x6B`), `PointAt`, `WaitForFirePrimaryMissiles`, `WaitForFireSecondaryMissiles`,
`WaitForPlayerSelectPrevTarget`, `WaitForPlayerSelectNextTarget`, `RememberThisCodeFrame`,
`KillRememberedCodeFrame`, the controls' switches from `DisableAfterburners` to `DisableTargeting`
(`0x73` to `0x78`), `FireMissileFromPort`, `ShowTip`, `DisableSpecialMoves`, `WaitMS` (`0x7C`),
`SetCameraZoom`, `ClearCameraZoom`, `SetDirectionalLighting`, `SetPlayCentre`, `AddObjective`,
`DeleteObjective`, `ShowObjectives`, `SetDataTag`, `SetShipName`, `StartVisibleCountdown`,
`DriftToTarget`, `CreateFomation`, `DestroyFormation`, `RemoveDataTag`, `PopAI`, `EjectSubobject`,
`TriggerExplosion`, `ShakeCamera`, `FireMissile`, `Magnetise`, `AddObjectiveTextID`,
`MarauderBombingRun`, `AlignFomation`, `RemoveShip`, `CreateIceAsteroidField`, `SetSafePerimeter`,
`EjectSubobjectUnderGravity`, `AttackMassiveObject`, `ShowObjectiveNum`,
`ShipFollowCurveAggressive`, `SetFormationTarget`, `SetSingleShipAvoidance`, `Random`,
`PrintDebugMessageNumeric`, `Set Formation Break` and `is SubObjectDead` (`0xA0`).

## Trigger conditions

The executable names StarLancer's 35 conditions, with the Ripper's two renamed
`TroopshipGrabbedObject` and `TroopshipDroppedObject`, and the console's buttons still among them,
such as `Player_L1_DoubleTap`. It names new ones too: `JumpedOut`, `ShotAtMissile`,
`Troopship Repelled`, `Collision`, `Docked With (Amasser)`, `Launched From (Amasser)`,
`Roll Match Lost` and `Roll Match Lost Inner`. The missions' triggers use StarLancer's numbers for
StarLancer's conditions, and numbers from 35 for new ones. **Unverified:** which new name has which
number. `sltool bsg triggers` shows the conditions by StarLancer's names, so the Troopship's show as
the Ripper's, and new ones by number.

## Stats

The stats are text files rather than StarLancer's binary tables
([Stat tables](../formats/stats.md)). A record starts with a line that names it, then has a line
for each field: a name and a colon, then its values.

| File | A record starts with | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `ship.txt` | `SHIP: <type> INDEX: <n>`, such as `SHIP: SHV1VI00 INDEX: 0` | StarLancer's flight model, `MAXSPEED`, `MAXROLL`, `MAXPITCH`, `MAXYAW` and the four inertias from `SPEEDINERTIA` to `YAWINERTIA`, then `AFTERBURNERMULTIPLIER`, `REVERSETHRUSTMULTIPLIER`, `ACCELERATION`, `DECELERATION`, `TURNACCELERATION`, `TURNDECELERATION`, `ARMOURSTRENGTH`, `BLASTRADIUS`, `BLASTLIFE` and `BLASTDAMAGE`. Each has two values. **Unknown:** what the second is. |
| `bullet.txt` | The gun's name, such as `COL_LASERMK1` | `LIFE`, `SPEED`, `DAMAGE` and `FIRERATE`, as StarLancer's range, speed, damage and fire rate, then `BLASTRADIUS` and `BLASTLIFE`. |
| `missile.txt` | The missile's name, such as `COL_DUMBMK1` | A ship's flight model, inertias included, then `LIFE`, `DAMAGE`, `BLASTRADIUS` and `BLASTLIFE`. StarLancer's missiles share the ships' flight model at run time, but its file gives them a speed and a turn rate alone. |
| `pilot.txt` | `PILOT_<name>` | `FLYINGSKILL`, `FLYINGACCURACY`, `FLYINGREACTIONTIME`, `GUNNERYSKILL`, `GUNNERYFIREAMOUNT`, `GUNNERYFIREDELAY`, the least and most delays between missiles and between chaff, `COURAGE`, `VERBOSITY` and `AGGRESSION`. |

## Combat maneuvers

`evade.txt` weighs the combat maneuvers ([Maneuvers](../engine/maneuvers.md)) for each of a set of
ships, starting `SHIP: <type>`, at three ranges, `NEAR:`, `MEDIUM:` and `FAR:`. Each line names a
maneuver and gives four weights. **Unknown:** what each of the four is for.

The first ten maneuvers are StarLancer's ten, in StarLancer's order: `AIDEFEND_DODGE1` to
`AIDEFEND_DODGE3`, `AIDEFEND_OUTOFACTIONSPHERE`, `AIDEFEND_RUNAWAY`, `AIATTACK_PURSUE`,
`AIATTACK_MASSIVEOBJECT`, `AIATTACK_MEDIUMFIGHTER`, `AIDEFEND_LOOPTHELOOP` and `AIDEFEND_RUNTOSHIP`.
Nine are new: `AIDEFEND_MAINTAINFORWARDVECTOR`, `AIDEFEND_PEELAWAYLEFTRIGHT`,
`AIDEFEND_PEELAWAYUPDOWN`, `AIDEFEND_JINK`, `AIDEFEND_REVERSEANDFLIP`, `AIDEFEND_STRAFE`,
`AIDEFEND_ROLL_ATTACK`, `AIDEFEND_VIPER_BRAKE` and `AIDEFEND_SLIDER`.

## Comms films

The faces in the comms are StarLancer's face films ([Face films](../formats/fm8.md)).
`comms\videodata.dat` holds the films back to back, and `comms\video.idx` gives their count, a word
of 256 (**Unknown**), then each film's offset. A film is a 12-byte header, then chunks:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | `VQ03` |
| 4 | 4 | The frames' size: two 16-bit values, 128 and 128 |
| 8 | 4 | One more than the film's frames, in every film |

The chunks are StarLancer's `fYEK` key frames and `fLED` delta frames, with the same key frame
header, but without StarLancer's XOR scrambling. No `fDNE` chunk ends a film. `sltool bsg film`
decodes them with StarLancer's face film decoder.

`vqmdata.txt` and `movies.txt` list comms films by name, such as `AD_01_01`, each with a `-` and a
number from 0 to 2, separated by tabs. **Unknown:** what the number is.

## Archives

The `.hxb` files are Warthog's own archive, `WART3.00`: a header, a table of entries, the members
back to back, and the members' names at the end. All numbers are little-endian.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | `WART3.00` |
| 8 | 4 | The count of entries |
| 12 | 4 | Where the names start, which is also where the members end |
| 16 | 4 | The names' length |
| 20 | | The entries, 20 bytes each |

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | Where the member starts in the archive |
| 4 | 4 | The bytes it takes, or 0 for a member stored as it is |
| 8 | 4 | Its size once unpacked |
| 12 | 4 | Its checksum |
| 16 | 4 | Where its name starts in the names |

The members start right after the entries, in the entries' order, with nothing between them. A
member stored as it is takes its unpacked size. More than half the sounds are stored that way,
and a few textures. Every other member is compressed with RefPack
([RefPack compression](../formats/refpack.md)), in chunks of 128 KiB of unpacked data, the last
chunk holding what is left. Each chunk is a 4-byte length, then a stream of RefPack commands of
that length, without the header that StarLancer's streams start with. Each chunk's stream unpacks
on its own.

The checksum is the CRC-32 of the unpacked member, without the final inversion that the usual
CRC-32 (zlib's) applies: zlib's CRC-32 of the member XOR `0xFFFFFFFF`.

The names are relative paths with forward slashes, such as `models/shv1vi00/shv1vi00.mdl`, each
ending in a zero byte. An archive can hold the same file more than once, each copy with its own
entry but sharing one name. `bigwad.hxb` holds some of the Galactica's textures up to twelve
times, each copy near a model that uses it. **Unverified:** that the copies let the game read a
model's files in one pass from the disc.

`sltool bsg ls` lists an archive, and `sltool bsg extract` unpacks every file of it, checking each
checksum and writing a repeated file once. The code is in
[`src/formats/games/bsg/wart.zig`](../../src/formats/games/bsg/wart.zig).

| Archive | Holds |
|---|---|
| `bigwad.hxb` | The models (`models/<model>/`), their textures (`models/textures/`) and the objects' definitions (`levels/`). |
| `wads\<mission>.hxb` | What a mission loads: its models, textures and definitions, its music (`music/`), its sounds (`audio/`) and the in-game menus' pictures (`gui/backend/`). |
| `gui.hxb` | The menus' pictures (`gui/frontend/`, `gui/backend/`) and their text in each language (`gui/lang/<language>.loc`). |
| `sfx.hxb` | The sound effects (`sfx/`) and short pieces of music (`music/`). |
| `extra.hxb` | The fonts, the effects' sprites and pictures, and the particle effects' definitions (`levels/`). |

### The files

| Kind | Format | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `.lvl` | Text | An object's definition ([Object definitions](#object-definitions)), or a particle effect's. |
| `.mdl` | Text | A model's parts ([Models](#models)). |
| `.bmsh` | Binary | A part's mesh ([Meshes](#meshes)). |
| `.banr` | Binary | **Unknown.** It comes with some meshes, under the same name ([#1037](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1037)). |
| `.btga` | Binary | A texture ([Textures](#textures)). |
| `.bwav` | Binary | A sound. **Unknown:** its layout ([#1036](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1036)). |
| `.bxm` | Binary | A piece of music. **Unknown:** its layout ([#1036](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1036)). |
| `.set` | Text | Lists of numbers, beside each mission's music and in `sfx/coll.set`. **Unknown:** what they set. |
| `.tnf` | Binary | A font's table, 2050 bytes, with its picture as a `.btga` of the same name. **Unknown:** its layout. |
| `.loc` | Text | The menus' text in one language. |

### Binary files

Every binary kind but the fonts has the same layout: a 12-byte start, then sections to the end of
the file.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | When the file was written, as a Unix time, from 2002 to 2004 |
| 4 | 4 | 4 in a mesh, 1 in the other kinds. **Unknown:** whether it is a version. |
| 8 | 4 | The same in every file of a kind but the textures, which have five values. **Unknown:** what it is. |

A section is a count of items, their total size, the size of each item, and then the items back to
back:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | The count of items |
| 4 | 4 | Their total size |
| 8 | 4 each | Each item's size |
| | | The items |

What the items hold depends on the kind of file. Many hold what look like the addresses they had in
the Xbox's memory when the file was written. The code is in
[`resource.zig`](../../src/formats/games/bsg/resource.zig).

### Textures

A texture is one section of a header, a palette and the texels:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | The width, a power of two |
| 4 | 4 | The height, a power of two |
| 8 | 4 | The count of levels |
| 12 | 4 | The format, by the Xbox's Direct3D numbers: `0x0B` for 8-bit indices into the palette, `0x07` for 32-bit colour |
| 16 | 4 | 0 in every texture |
| 20 | 12 | 2, 2 and 2 in every texture. **Unknown.** |
| 32 | 96 | 0 in every texture |

The palette is a texture's second item, of 32 to 256 colours of 4 bytes each: blue, green, red and
alpha. In most palettes the alpha is 0 for every colour, and OpenReliant takes such a texture as
opaque. The 32-bit textures, the front end's skies, have no palette, and their texels are blue,
green, red and a byte that isn't used. The last item holds every level's texels, largest first,
padded to a multiple of 4 bytes, each level swizzled as the Xbox keeps textures
([Xbox formats](../formats/xbox.md#textures)).

### Meshes

A mesh is a part of a model: its triangles, the materials they take, and their collision data. Its
first section holds the mesh's header, a 184-byte record for each submesh, and each submesh's
material, as a 100-byte record and the names of four textures, empty for none:

| Item | Size | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x38` | The header |
| 1 | 184 for each submesh | **Unknown:** the submeshes' records. An environment-mapped submesh's holds the text `spherical`. |
| 2 + 5n | 100 | Submesh n's material |
| 3 + 5n to 6 + 5n | | Its textures' names, such as `sh_v2_viper01.tga`, each ending in a zero byte |

| Offset | Size | Field of the header |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | The count of submeshes |
| `0x18` | 12 | Half the mesh's size along each axis |
| `0x24` | 12 | The middle of its box |
| `0x30` | 4 | **Unverified:** the radius of a sphere about the middle |

| Offset | Size | Field of a material |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | What it draws: 0 no texture, 2 its texture, 4 a texture whose name ends in a frame's number, such as `launchtube main000.tga`, 6 its texture with an environment map as its second. **Unknown:** 1. |
| `0x2C` | 4 | How it joins what is behind it: 0 it covers it, 1 it adds to it, as lasers, glows and particles do, 5 **Unverified:** it mixes with it by the texture's alpha, as clouds and skies do |

A section of collision data follows in all but a few meshes: positions and a tree of 64-byte boxes.
**Unknown:** its layout ([#1037](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1037)). A
mesh with no submeshes, such as a bridge's, holds only collision data.

A section for each submesh then holds its triangles and its vertices, each kind of value an array
of its own, as 11 items:

| Item | Holds |
|---|---|
| 0 | A `0x4C`-byte record: the count of vertices at `0x0C`, and of indices at `0x34` |
| 1 | The triangles, three 16-bit indices each, padded to a multiple of 4 bytes |
| 2 | The positions, three floats each |
| 3 | The normals, three floats each |
| 4 | The colours, red, green, blue and alpha floats, or empty for none |
| 5 | The texture coordinates for the first texture, two floats each, or empty for none |
| 6 | The texture coordinates for the second, or empty for none |
| 7 to 10 | Empty in every mesh. **Unknown.** |

The code is in [`mesh.zig`](../../src/formats/games/bsg/mesh.zig).

### Object definitions

A `.lvl` file in `levels/` defines an object that a mission can place: a ship, a station or a
piece of scenery, by the name its model has, such as `levels/shv1vi00.lvl` for the Viper
(`SHV1VI00`, the name `ship.txt` uses too). It is a block of attributes:

```text
level
{
    name({SHV1VI00})
    acount(99)
    pcount(0)
    scount(0)
    tcount(0)
    ocount(0)
    attribute({ObjectType}, const, number,1)
    attribute({MeshName}, const, string,{SHV1VI00})
    attribute({MaxSpeed}, const, number,300)
    attribute({Gun1}, const, vector,-163,-107.000008,116.999992,0)
    ...
}
```

`acount` is the count of attributes. Each attribute has a name, `const` or `amend`, a type
(`number`, `string` or `vector`) and its value; strings are in braces. **Unknown:** what `amend`
changes, and what `pcount`, `scount` and `tcount` count: they are 0 in every file. A particle
effect's file has `ocount` blocks after its attributes, such as an `EmitterClass` block of the
emitter's directions, colours and sizes.

A ship's attributes give:

- its flight model, as `ship.txt` does (`MaxSpeed` to `YawInertia`, `Acceleration`, `TurnAccel`),
  and a second set for the player (`PlayerMaxSpeed` and so on);
- what it is: `ShipType` (`FIGHTER`, `STATIC`), `FlightModel`, `FriendOrFoe` and `Targetable`;
- its weapons by name, as `bullet.txt` and `missile.txt` name them: `PrimaryWeaponType`
  (`COL_LASERMK1`), `SubPrimaryWeaponType`, `SecondaryWeaponType` and `SubSecondaryWeaponType`;
- where its guns' muzzles are (`Gun1`, `Gun2`) and its engines' glows (`Jet1` to `Jet3`, with
  `Jet1Size` and so on), as positions in the model's space;
- its hardpoints, each a type, an ID and a matrix as four vectors, such as `Secondary00_type`,
  `Secondary00_ID` and `Secondary00_xform0` to `Secondary00_xform3`, the last being the position.
  The types are `SECONDARY` and `SUBSECONDARY`, for the two kinds of missile, `TURRET` and
  `PLAYERTURRET`, `LAUNCHTUBE`, `SUBOBJECT`, `LEECHPOINT` and `LEECHBEAM`;
- where the cockpit and the chase camera are (`CockpitOffset`, `CameraOffset`);
- the distances at which it changes to a coarser model (`LODDist1` to `LODDist5`);
- its engine's sounds (`EngineSound`, `EngineAfterburnSound`), and its blast when it explodes.

They hold what StarLancer splits between a model's attachment points
([`.SHP` models](../formats/shp.md)) and its ship stats ([Stat tables](../formats/stats.md)).

### Models

A `.mdl` file is a model's parts as Maya exported them. Each part is a `model` block inside the
model's own, which starts with a comment naming the Maya scene, such as
`Z:/BattleStar/SHIPS/sh_v1_viper01/models/sh_v1_viper01.mb`:

```text
    model
    {
// Maya scene Z:/BattleStar/SHIPS/sh_v1_viper01/models/sh_v1_viper01.mb
        name({c1_viper01})
        parent({})
        matrix(1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1)
        meshname({SHV1VI00c1_viper01Shape.msh})
    }
```

A part has a name, its parent's name (empty for none), a 4 by 4 matrix, a `pivot` point, and the
mesh it draws. The mesh is the file of that name in the model's folder, in lowercase and with
`.bmsh` for `.msh`. The matrix is Direct3D's, row by row: a point is a row multiplied by it, and its
last row is where the part stands in its parent's frame. A part's vertices are in its own frame,
and its pivot is where it turns, such as a turret's barrels about their pivot.

Most parts' names hold their level of detail, `c1` to `c5`, 1 the finest, as the first word between
underscores that is `c` and a digit: `c1_viper2`, or `sh_bs_basestar01_c4_basestar_top`. Each level
has its own parts: the Viper has one part at each level, and the Galactica 84 parts at the first and
none at the others. The pieces a ship breaks into, such as `xd_debris01`, have no level.

A hardpoint of an object's definition with an `_object` attribute mounts another model there, such
as a launch tube's door (`ltgaga01`) or the Galactica's turrets (`WGT1LA00`). **Unverified:** that a
turret's `_MinRotX` to `_MaxRotY` attributes limit how far it turns.

### The frame

The positions are in Direct3D's left-handed frame: X to the right, Y up and Z forward. The Viper's
nose is at +Z and its canopy at +Y. Seen from its front, a triangle's corners go clockwise. The
executable shows it. The routine at `0x000CE060`, which sets Direct3D's render states for what is
drawn next, sets render state `0x93`, the cull mode, to `0x901`, `D3DCULL_CCW`, which culls the
triangles whose corners go counter-clockwise on the screen; to `0x900`, `D3DCULL_CW`, where a flag
at `0x0044DE10` is set; and to 0, `D3DCULL_NONE`, for what is drawn from both sides
(`0x000CF177` on).

### To glTF

`sltool bsg gltf` writes a model of an archive as glTF 2.0, for a modelling tool such as Blender,
with its textures as PNG files beside it. `sltool shp from-gltf` builds a StarLancer model of it
for a mod ([Models from glTF](../guide/modding.md#models-from-gltf)). A fighter needs no `--scale`:
the Viper is 1226 units long, as long as StarLancer's fighters. `sltool bsg textures` saves every
texture of an archive as a PNG file.

- The model's node is named as the model is, such as `shv2vi00`. Its `extras` hold the Maya scene
  and every attribute of the object's definition.
- Each part at the level `--lod` gives, 1 by default, or the nearest level the model has, is a node
  under its parent's, named as the part is, with its mesh and its place. The parts without a level
  are written at every level. A part's pivot is in its node's `extras`.
- Each submesh is a primitive with its texture coordinates, and its colours as the attribute
  `_COLOR`, which a reader keeps without drawing. Its material is named after its texture, whose
  picture is `<texture>.png` beside the glTF file. An additive material is black with its picture
  as its glow, a mixed one is blended by its alpha, and an opaque one with alpha in its picture
  is masked by it. The material's record and its textures' names are in its `extras`.
- The guns, jets, vapour trails and cockpit are empty nodes named `gun_muzzle`, `engine_glow:1`,
  `vapour_trail` and `cockpit_view`. A jet's glow is as large next to its ship as StarLancer's
  fighters' glows: its marker's scale, from which `from-gltf` takes the glow's size, is twice its
  `Jet<n>Size` across and eight times it along, 120 by 120 by 480 for the Viper's jets of 60, as a
  Crusader's glows are 100 by 100 by 400. The hardpoints are empty nodes placed and turned by their matrices, named `missile` for
  `SECONDARY`, `launch_point` for `LAUNCHTUBE`, and by their kind for the others, such as `turret`,
  with their attributes in their `extras`. A model mounted on a hardpoint is written under it in
  the same way, up to four mounts deep.
- Every X is negated, to turn Direct3D's left-handed frame into glTF's right-handed one, and every
  triangle's corners go the other way round, so that the model isn't mirrored and its triangles
  face out.

`from-gltf` reads the gun muzzles, the engine glows, the missiles and the launch points, and passes
over the other markers. **Unverified:** what a jet's size measures, and so how large its glow is.
**Not written:** the collision data, the environment maps, and an animated texture's frames past
the first ([#1037](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/1037)).
The code is in [`to_gltf.zig`](../../src/formats/games/bsg/to_gltf.zig).
