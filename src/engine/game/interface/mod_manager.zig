//! The mods screen (`ModManager`), which GAME OPTIONS' MODS button opens: a list of the mods in the
//! game's `mods` folder ([#497](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/497)). A check box
//! turns each mod on or off, a box of up and down arrows sets the order the mods load in, and the
//! panel on the right shows the chosen mod's thumbnail, what its manifest says of it, the mods whose
//! files it replaces or that replace its, and why it doesn't load where it doesn't. The order
//! and the state are kept in `starlancer.ini`'s `[OpenReliantMods]` section (`bigfile.mods.Order`)
//! as they change, and take effect the next time OpenReliant starts, which the screen says while
//! they differ from what is loaded.
//!
//! It is laid out as the settings screen's controls tab is, on the same shapes
//! (`settings.shapes_name`): a framed list with the lists' arrows, a second frame beside it, and the
//! buttons of the settings screen. OK and MAIN MENU leave. REFRESH, where RESET DEFAULTS stands on the
//! settings screen, reads the `mods` folder again, to find the mods added or removed since OpenReliant
//! started. CANCEL CHANGES puts the mods back as they were when the screen opened. OPTIONS, in the
//! panel, opens the page of options the chosen mod's scripts offer, where it has one
//! (`mod_options`).
//!
//! **Improvement:** the original can't load mods.
