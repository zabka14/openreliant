//! `C:\lancer\game\hud.cpp`: the head-up display drawn over the view. `hud_draw` (`0x004843B0`)
//! draws it once a frame; `mission_run` puts it in `sr + 0x88` and Surrender calls it while it
//! renders. [`hud.md`](../../../docs/engine/hud.md) describes the file.
//!
//! Ported so far: `hud_draw`'s order (`draw`), where an element stands, its text, the readouts,
//! the clock, the status lights with the devices' charges, the jump prompt, the player's target
//! with the keys that pick it (`targetKeys`, `drawTarget`), the eject marker, the scanner, the
//! ship status indicator in both its modes, the targeting cluster, the radar's rings, ranges and
//! contacts, the windows and what they show ([`hud/windows.zig`](hud/windows.zig)), and the
//! subtarget's parts picked out in red ([`hud/subtarget.zig`](hud/subtarget.zig)). Not yet: the
//! rest of `hud_draw`, whose other elements [`hud.md`](../../../docs/engine/hud.md) lists, and what
//! a multiplayer game adds ([#55](https://github.com/OpenReliant/openreliant/issues/55)).
//!
//! **Improvement:** The game draws the display with the processor, whichever renderer is running:
//! `hud_text` hands its line to `VFX_string_draw`, out of `vfx.dll`, which blits each glyph into a
//! pane a pixel at a time. OpenReliant draws a glyph as a textured rectangle through the device
//! instead, so on the GPU the display costs the processor nothing and scales without blurring. What
//! it draws is the same: a glyph's bytes index the font's own palette, as they do for
//! `VFX_character_draw`, and index 0 is left clear. The state is the engine's own, an overlay-layer
//! depth and its alpha blend. `--original` draws the same way, since OpenReliant draws the display
//! larger on a larger window (`UiScale`), where the game blitted it at its own size.
