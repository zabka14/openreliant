//! The pause menu's items and how they are drawn: `menu_draw` (`0x0048DB00`) and the pieces the
//! screens are made of. A screen is a list of `Item`s and what choosing each does; `buttons` makes
//! the buttons the screens share.
//! [`pause-menu.md`](../../../../docs/engine/pause-menu.md#menu-items) describes them.
//!
//! **Improvement:** The game lays a menu out in pixels about fractions of the screen, at the size
//! of its art whatever the screen's. OpenReliant multiplies the pixels by the UI's scale
//! (`hud.UiScale`), as it does the display's, so the menu keeps its proportions on a larger screen;
//! at a scale of 1 it is the game's own layout.
