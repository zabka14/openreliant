//! `C:\lancer\game\main.cpp`: a mission's loop. `mission_run` (`0x00494040`) runs a game tick for
//! each tick of the timer and draws a frame with `mission_frame` (`0x004924B0`). **Unverified:**
//! the two lie after `language.cpp`'s code, where `main.cpp`'s begins; by what they do they are
//! this file's.
//!
//! Ported so far: the clocks and the pacing, the mission's start (`startMission`), how
//! `mission_frame` runs the mission's script, frames the objects, reads the controls, moves the
//! camera, plays the frame's sound and puts the scene together and draws it, the damaged ships'
//! smoke (`smoke`), the armour's conditions (`0x00492370`), the pause (`game_pause`) and the paused
//! frame (`pausedFrame`). Not yet: the rest of the effects and of what it adds to the scene.
