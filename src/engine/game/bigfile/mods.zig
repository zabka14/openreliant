//! OpenReliant's mods: archives and folders in the game's `mods` folder whose files replace or add
//! to the game's files. A file in a mod replaces every game file with the same name, wherever the
//! game keeps it: inside its archives (`resource.hog`, and the speech, pilot face and CD archives)
//! or as a loose file, such as the music, movies, missions and stat tables. Files with new names
//! are added. PNG pictures in a mod (`Mods.pictures`) replace the game's images at any size:
//! textures from the texture cache, with their material maps, sprite shapes and TGA pictures.
//! TrueType and OpenType fonts in a mod replace the game's fonts, and are drawn at the window's
//! resolution (`hud.outline`). A mod's line of speech replaces the game's with or without the
//! extension the game's code gives it, `.ut` (`radio.readLine`).
//!
//! A mod is an archive in the game's format (a `.hog` file) or a folder of files, which is handy
//! while making a mod. A folder is read the same way as the archive `sltool hog pack` would make
//! from it. Names have no folders, as in the archives, and where the game has several files with
//! the same name, they are copies of each other. Mods take priority over the game's files, and a
//! mod that loads later over an earlier one. Mods load in the order of their names unless the mods
//! screen has set an order and turned some off (`Order`). Each mod can describe itself in a
//! manifest, `mod.ini`. [docs/guide/modding.md](../../../../docs/guide/modding.md) is the
//! modding guide.
//!
//! **Improvement:** the original can't load mods.
