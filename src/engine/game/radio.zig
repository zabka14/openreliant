//! The reports (`Report`) wait their time and are then said as lines: PERMISSION TO LAND's answer
//! and the wingmen's replies to their commands (`wingmen`) queue them. The remarks (`Remarks`) are
//! the lines the game has the pilots say by itself: the reminders to land and to jump, the warning
//! of a missile, and the words on a kill, a ship lost, a pilot ejecting, a hit on the player and a
