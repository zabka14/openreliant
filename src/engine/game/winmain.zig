//! `C:\lancer\game\winmain.cpp`: the game's entry, `WinMain` (`0x004A8B10`), and its message pump.
//! **Unverified:** the pump (`0x004AAB20`), the queue of characters typed (`0x004AADA0` on) and the
//! list of call signs' reading and writing (`0x004AAE00`, `0x004AAEE0`) lie after the last of the
//! file's code that its assertions place; by what they do they are this file's.
//!
//! Ported so far: what the pump does as the game's window goes inactive and active again, as far
//! as the sound and the pause go; the characters typed, which the window's procedure queues; the
//! list of call signs the settings keep; and what follows a mission of the campaign
//! (`afterMission`), with the movies of a lost mission and of a career's end, which scripts can
//! choose (`lostMovie`, `careerOverMovie`). `openreliant`'s own frame loop stands in for the rest.
