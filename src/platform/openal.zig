//! The Miles Sound System's calls ([`engine/mss.zig`](../engine/mss.zig)'s `Driver`), played by
//! OpenAL Soft in place of the 3D providers the game chose between: Miles's own, DirectSound3D, EAX,
//! A3D. OpenAL renders into memory through its loopback device, which the platform's audio stream
//! pulls from, so none of its own device backends are used.
//!
//! What the game asked of its provider maps across as it is: each 3D sample's distances, as the
//! inverse distance clamped model DirectSound3D had; its cone; its velocity's Doppler shift; its
//! pitch and volume. Samples play by their pan from ahead, streams stereo straight to the
//! speakers. **Improvements:** OpenAL's band-limited sinc resampler and its smoothing of every
//! change; UHJ stereo, or HRTF for headphones, where Miles panned left and right; as many speakers as
//! the device has; a listener that moves, a stronger Doppler shift, sounds with a size, high
//! frequencies fading with distance, a subwoofer; a reverb on the 3D sounds, of the generic room
//! the game asks EAX for with its effect volume at nothing, or of a hangar while a launch shows one
//! from within, and on the sounds of a carrier's rooms and its briefing room, of a room of the
//! ship; and one of a cabin on the cockpit's own voice.
