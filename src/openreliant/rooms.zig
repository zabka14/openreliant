//! each in a loop of its own, as the game runs them, each frame drawn over an empty scene and put
//! on the window, with the window's messages read as the message pump reads them, and the movies
//! between them played by `Movies`. `campaign` is what `WinMain` does as START GAME starts a
//! campaign, or LOAD GAME loads one, `goOn` as the campaign goes on after a mission, and `restart`
//! and `replayBriefing` as it turns back to a mission the pilot did not come through. The in-game
//! options' SAVE and LOAD open the saved games (`game.interface.saved_games`); a game loaded takes

//! (`game.interface.settings`). In the developer mode, F11 brings the scripting console up over
